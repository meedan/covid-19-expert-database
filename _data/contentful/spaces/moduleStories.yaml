    description: The World Health Organization (WHO) today launched a new alliance,
      the Africa Infodemic Response Alliance (AIRA), to coordinate actions and pool
      resources in combating misinformation around COVID-19 pandemic and other health
      emergencies in Africa.
    body: "Digital platforms have been inundated with COVID-19-related information
      since the pandemic began in late 2019. Information about the virus has been
      shared and viewed over 270 billion times online and mentioned almost 40 million
      times on Twitter and web-based news sites in the 47 countries of the WHO African
      Region between February and November 2020, according to UN Global Pulse, the
      United Nations’ Secretary-General’s initiative on big data and artificial intelligence.
      \n\nA large proportion of this information is inaccurate and misleading and
      continues to be shared by social media users intentionally or unknowingly everyday.
      The COVID-19 infodemic is amplified online through social media but health misinformation
      is also circulating offline.  \n\nMeasuring precisely how much of what is circulating
      is misinformation is difficult, but fact-checking organizations in Africa say
      they have debunked more than 1000 of such misleading reports since the onset
      of the pandemic. Some of the widely shared misinformation include conspiracies
      around unproven treatments, false cures and anti-vaccine messages. \n\n> “In
      health emergencies, misinformation can kill and ensure diseases continue to
      spread. People need proven, science-based facts to make informed decisions about
      their health and well-being, and a glut of information - an infodemic - with
      misinformation in the mix makes it hard to know what is right and real. This
      crucial new alliance brings unique reach, knowledge and skills to help stop
      the impact of dangerous misinformation,” said Dr Matshidiso Moet, WHO Regional
      Director for Africai.\n\nAmong others, the  Africa Infodemic Response Alliance
      \ will work collaboratively to counter false information around COVID-19 vaccines
      and complement on the ground public health awareness raising and community engagement
      efforts by creating demand for vaccines in the region.\n\nThe network is the
      first initiative of its kind and it brings together 13 international and regional
      organizations and fact-checking groups with expertise in data and behavioural
      science, epidemiology, research, digital health, and communications to detect,
      disrupt and counter damaging misinformation on public health issues in Africa.
      \n\nThe Alliance will encourage proactive disclosure by data holders and support
      journalists and media outlets to effectively share lifesaving information based
      on scientific evidence and debunk disinformation on health issues. It also aims
      to support individual African countries in developing tailored infodemic management
      strategies, including analysing trends and behaviours, recruiting specialists
      and refining systematic engagement strategies rooted in research and analytics.\n\nThis
      initiative puts into practice key recommendations on infodemic management that
      were developed by over 1300 experts from across disciplines in early 2020 under
      the auspices of WHO’s global Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN).\n\nThe
      Alliance members are Africa CDC, the International Federation of the Red Cross
      and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the United Nations Verified initiative, the
      United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), The United Nations Educational, Scientific
      and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and United Nations Global Pulse. Participating
      and supporting bodies include Africa Check, Agence France-Presse Fact Check,
      PesaCheck, Dubawa and Meedan.\n\n> \"Close coordination among fact-checkers,
      public health institutions and other communications stakeholders is essential
      for addressing the unique midinformation challenges we face today, where informational
      ambiguity based on scant or conflicting evidence, or emerging scientific knowledge
      can exacerbate the spread of disease,\" said Nat Gyenes, Director Meedan's Digital
      Health Lab."

    body: |
      In time for the municipal elections across Brazil this past weekend, Meedan is pleased to announce three new Brazilian partners using our Check software for fact-checking on WhatsApp. They are: [Estadão Verifica](https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,estadao-verifica-lanca-novo-servico-por-whatsapp,70003506752 "Estadão Verifica"), an initiative of Estadão; [Agência Lupa](https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/lupa/2020/10/22/lupa-canal-whatsapp/ "Agência Lupa"), and [Fato ou Fake ](https://g1.globo.com/fato-ou-fake/noticia/2020/11/11/fato-ou-fake-lanca-bot-exclusivo-para-checar-conteudos-duvidosos.ghtml "Fato ou Fake"), by Globo Group. The latter initiative brings together journalists from G1, O Globo, Extra, Época, Valor, CBN, GloboNews and TV Globo.

      Check is a tool for collaborative verification and annotation of digital media, with new features customized specifically for global fact-checking organizations. It's been deployed by  AFP (in Brazil and India), Africa Check, BOOM and India Today. These organization have been using Check since October 2019 across 4 languages and more than 180,000 submissions, including ongoing submissions today. Our case study on this program, called [End-to-End Fact-Checking](https://meedan.com/files/Meedan-WhatsApp-Case-Study-End-to-End-Fact-Checking.pdf?utm_source=website&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=global-fact), details the insights, field research and product features that maximized the value of the WhatsApp API for fact checkers around the world; it’s name is a reference to the program’s ability to successfully fact-check on WhatsApp's end-to-end encrypted platform.

      Natália Leal, content director at Lupa agency explains the importance of Check, “This tool expands the scope of Lupa's work, while at the same time bringing the agency closer to the public. It strengthens our monitoring of the false information environment and allows our reader another channel of communication with us. Thus, he has more access to verified information when making decisions that impact his life and society."

      And for Estadão's, editor-in-chief David Friedlander, “Fake news deceives, misinforms and creates an atmosphere of confusion. That's why professional journalism is so important. With it's checking services, Estadão is dedicated to restoring the value of correct and reliable information”.

      The new partners joined AFP Checamos, a pioneer in Brazil in the use of Check in their verification process on WhatsApp. “The tool has greatly improved the way we communicate with our WhatsApp audience,” said Maria Clara Pestre, AFP fact checker Checamos (Brazil). “Now, we can be sure that anyone who contacts us through the app will have an immediate and consistent response. At the same time, we have time to dedicate ourselves to the other steps in the verification process. ”

      We adapted our toolkit to help fact-checkers focus on their work, not on technical tasks. This allowed teams to create their own workflows inside Check.

      The platform has these main features:

      - It allows the verification teams, based on the demand of the newsroom, to create menus of interactive content (bots) using their messaging channels;
      - It imports the database of fact-checks from a journalistic organization, allowing them to send reports directly to the user of content that has already been verified.
      - It also allows the public to send content suggestion to be checked by journalists;

      For our partner organizations, the bot is an essential communication channel to engage their audience, understand and scale the demand for specific topics and distribute important information in other messaging networks. When building these relationships, it is also an opportunity to develop interactive monitoring and evaluation surveys with end users to assess the behavioral impacts of fact checks.

      Check enables a publishing system to send fact verification reports to users of direct channels (tiplines) who send duplicate or similar requests. “Our goal with Check,” explained Meedan's Product Director, Pierre Conti, “is to build a human and AI system so that fact checkers can efficiently scale the demand for verification directly from the public, cut whatever just noise and thus maximize the impact of the checks. We do this to help verifiers prioritize the most relevant misinformation. ”

      How do fact-checking groups running WhatsApp tiplines engage with users on WhatsApp?
      How do independent fact-checkers inform audiences about their tipline service?
      How do fact-checkers ensure that their WhatsApp tipline receives relevant queries from users?

      These are questions that fact-checking groups operating WhatsApp tiplines have often encountered. The WhatsApp audience is different from the existing audience on other social media platforms. According to fact-checking groups, audiences on WhatsApp prioritise promptness of response and shareability of verification reports. So how do groups position and promote the tipline service which does just that? Here are some best practices and a few examples of campaigns to inform the WhatsApp audience and promote the tipline product. These have been launched by partners that Meedan works with as part of its pilot project that focuses on End-to-End Fact-Checking on WhatsApp using the WhatsApp Business API. The ad campaigns have been supported by Facebook Journalism Project.
    body: "While ads are critical to building an audience, they have to be used strategically
      in order to maximize their impact for an organization's fact-checking work while
      reducing unactionable content. Ultimately, we’ve learned that ads combined with
      a community engagement strategy yield the most impactful projects, balancing
      the needs of both scale and quality. \n\nHere are a few things we learned through
      previous ad campaigns:\n\n1. Images work well with ad campaigns. Keep images
      that are compelling, related to the campaign and have a strong recall. Colours,
      logos, symbols and branding should be consistent across each part of the campaign.\n\n2.
      Make sure the organization's WhatsApp tipline number is prominently displayed,
      both in text that accompanies the ad and in the image itself so that people
      can catch the messaging. \n\n3. A focused call for action works well for ads
      and it’s always a good idea to follow the news cycle while designing tipline
      ad campaign. If an organization is focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic, it might
      be useful for them to specify what part of the pandemic-related misinformation
      can be verified - information related to vaccines, drugs, home remedies, lockdown
      related measures, new research, etc. Other significant news events such as elections,
      government announcements, and cyclones also result in more people sending queries
      to WhatsApp tiplines. Designing ads around these will guide WhatsApp users to
      send better and relevant submissions.  \n\n4. Ads with shorter descriptions
      (between 100 and 250 characters) are likely to get more engagement than ones
      that are more than 250 characters. So it’s best to have less text in an ad.
      \n\n5. Multimedia ads work well on online platforms - fun GIFs, videos, engaging
      visuals and memes with some text are all easily shareable and communicate clearly
      with users. \n\n6. Cross promotion helps build community faster. Posting ads
      on multiple online platforms, like Facebook and Instagram, is also likely to
      direct audiences from these platforms to WhatsApp tiplines. Organizations should
      also consider using similar graphics on Twitter, on their website, newsletter
      and public Facebook page, and other channels to engage existing audiences.\n\n7.
      Consistency in presentation helps users recall a brand. It’s a good idea for
      an organization to make style, colour palette, logos and fonts consistent across
      all their assets. For example, the WhatsApp profile photo of an organization's
      tipline should be the same as the organization's profile photo on Facebook or
      other online platforms. \n\n### Here are examples of some ad campaigns launched
      by our partners in different regions:\n\n#### AFP Checamos \n[The ad gives a

    body: "Since October 2019, Meedan has run a [global fact-checking project](https://meedan.com/files/Meedan-WhatsApp-Case-Study-End-to-End-Fact-Checking.pdf?utm_source=website&utm_medium=press-release&utm_campaign=global-fact)
      using the WhatsApp Business API and powered by [Check](https://meedan.com/check),
      an open-source platform built by Meedan. During the year, we entered into new
      and exciting partnerships with fact-checking groups and newsrooms across the
      globe to combat misinformation. As a community, we have made huge strides and
      learned from each other. \n\nStarting this month, we will speak to members of
      our partner organizations about their fact-checking experiences and their vision
      for the future. Here, we present the first interview of the series with Kritika
      Goel, Associate Editor at the Quint. \n\nKritika leads [WebQoof](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof),
      an independent fact-checking initiative of [The Quint](https://www.thequint.com/).
      According to Urban dictionary, WebQoof means someone who believes every word
      or information on the Internet and social media. We have been working with Kritika
      for the past five months and have found in her a passionate fact-checker, someone
      who gives honest feedback and is willing to take up new challenges. It has been
      a pleasure working with Kritika, one of the women leaders in the fact-check
      community.\n\n### How long have you been a fact-checker? What has been your
      experience before becoming one? What brought you to this?\n\nI started full
      time fact-checking in June 2019. Before that I was a  desk reporter and a part-time
      fact-checker. \n\nBut with every news break, I also saw a parallel narrative,
      shared on  social media and sometimes by mainstream news channels. This information,
      in some cases, was unverifiable and had no source. I just wanted to go to the
      root of the problem and understand where it is coming from. As a journalist
      we are taught to ask questions. For me an important question was -  what is
      the source of the information? Most of the time, there was no answer. It was
      after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, that I shifted to full-time fact-checking. \n\n###
      What is the Indian media and fact-checking ecosystem like? What are the strengths
      and what gaps do you see?\n\nIn India, there were smaller and independent fact-checking
      organizations like [Alt News](https://www.altnews.in/), [BOOM ](https://www.boomlive.in/)and
      [SM Hoax Slayer](https://smhoaxslayer.com/). Now we even have the mainstream
      media in this space. \n\nThere is a need for greater collaboration and resource
      sharing. We know that misinformation travels more widely and faster than fact-checks.
      If a viral piece of content is consumed by 100,000 people, are even 10% consuming
      the fact-checks? The motive is to amplify fact-checks and reach a wider audience.
      Only then we can combat misinformation. The idea is not to push out a story
      and to say that we have done a fact-check, but for people to get the right information.
      For that, there should be collaboration between fact-checkers, which is happening,
      but  should be at a bigger scale. There was a [ global collaboration under the
      International Fact Check Network](https://www.poynter.org/ifcn-covid-19-misinformation/?covid_countries=0&covid_rating=0&covid_fact_checkers=47485)
      for tackling COVID-19 related misinformation. I was able to fact-check two-three
      pieces of misinformation, including a video which was viral in India, but was
      originally from Taiwan by reaching out to [Summer Chen](https://twitter.com/SummerLake)
      of [Taiwan FactCheck Center](https://tfc-taiwan.org.tw/). So, collaboration
      really helps. \n\nCollaboration in distribution can also help in reaching a
      wider audience. For instance, The Quint has a certain audience and Alt News
      has another. Together, we reach a larger audience. When WebQoof started we used
      to reproduce content from BOOM, Alt and SM Hoax slayer, which helped in amplifying
      the reach of the content. I am sure that we can come up with better ways and
      see how fact-check content can reach a wider audience. \n\n### How important
      would you say is fact-checking in the current times? Do you see a real impact
      with the stories and fact-checking work you do?\n\nThere definitely is a need
      for fact-checking. It has become another branch of journalism.\n\nIn terms of
      impact, there is an alert audience who flags and identifies misinformation.
      Recently, we got in touch with individuals who tag us and other fact-checkers
      regularly on Twitter to flag misinformation. When we reply with the fact-check,
      they share it with others. They are like volunteers; by sharing verified information
      with their networks, they are amplifying the distribution and helping facts
      reach a wider audience. That is an impact for me and to highlight such contributions
      we did a [story on these citizen fact-checkers](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/how-citizens-joined-fact-checkers-in-the-fight-against-fake-news). \n\nWe
      have done so many stories on mainstream media sharing false information. They
      do not always acknowledge that there has been a mistake or issue a clarification,
      while they also have fact-check verticals. The fact that the mainstream media,
      including us, has fact-check verticals is itself an impact. Media organizations
      have realized that the audience is interested in facts and not just narratives
      and whataboutery. This is an impact brought about by the entire fact-checking
      community. \n\n### What is your most challenging fact-check experience and how
      did you work on it?\n\nThe recent amendment of [the Citizen Amendment Act (CAA)](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/citizenship-amendment-act-2019-all-you-need-to-know-11576401546515.html) 
      in India was followed by protests in many parts of the country. The Jamia Millia
      Islamia University became the centre of protests with clashes between pro and
      anti CAA student groups and heavy deployment of police forces. During this episode,
      there were claims that a  member of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP),
      the student wing of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, was seen exiting the
      university compound wearing a police gear.This was used to claim that the government
      and police were not doing their job and were involved in the violence inside
      the campus. However, the person was a cop in civilian clothes wearing a gear. \n\nWe
      got in touch with the ABVP member who was misidentified, the concerned cop and
      the people who were around when the incident took place. Luckily we had reporters
      on the ground. But, it took us over a day to speak to the cop in concern, to
      reach out to people and also to verify if what they said is the truth or not.
      It was very difficult at that point. \n\nWe could not take anybody at face value
      and had to verify everything to make sure that they were telling us the truth.
      During this time, there were also other social media posts misidentifying people.
      So, this was an important [story ](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/did-abvp-member-attack-protesting-students-disguised-as-cop-fact-check)to
      do at that point. Four of our team members were involved in the story and we
      wanted it to be watertight.\n\nAs a fact-checker and journalist, my biggest
      nightmare is what if we verify a piece of information based on inputs from an
      individual and they aren't telling us the truth? So, I do not take anything
      at face value and look for evidence to put forth the facts. \n\n### You recently
      took charge of Quint's fact-check team. How is the new experience and what are
      your plans for the team?\n\nI have been working with WebQoof for over a year.
      Since my senior editor moved on, I have the new responsibility of leading the
      team. It is definitely exciting as there is a lot happening in the misinformation
      space.\n\nAn important strategy for me is to do more ground reports so that
      we can bring out the truth and put forth the facts from the ground.\n\nSince
      the beginning of my work at WebQoof, I have been interested in media literacy.
      Once you empower the reader, it will help in expanding the community. An individual
      can be a fact-checker in their family and friends WhatsApp groups. Many of us
      started off like that.\n\nWe also intend to do a lot more in the health fact-checking
      space . The pandemic  has really shown how prevalent and detrimental health
      misinformation is. After the COVID-19 outbreak, we are receiving more fact-check
      requests on general health misinformation as well. So the key focus areas for
      me would be: Media literacy, more ground reports and focus on health misinformation. \n\n###
      How do you deal with the pressure in having to respond to misinformation on
      a daily basis and even come across some distressing content?\n\nFor the longest
      time, I thought I was immune to violent and graphic content and did not get
      impacted. But there are days when we have to look at gory images, blood, violence
      all day; I think why is there so much hatred and violence? There are really
      distressing videos where you see people thrash and hurt each other. \n\nSometimes,
      it does not affect me. But, I also keep chatting with my team members, because
      there are people who get really impacted and post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) is a real thing. \n\nOnce my team member said, \"I go back home, I just
      think about these'. Sometimes we want that choice to not look at distressing
      content. There are days when you feel low because of it. I wish we had a choice,
      but it is part of the job of a fact-checker. \n\nI speak to my team very  proactively;
      we are a bunch of young people and we understand each other well. There are
      days when you should take a step back and not look at content that is disturbing.
      I was lucky to have a senior editor who took note of all this and made sure
      we were not too overwhelmed (for the want of a better work) with the kind of
      content we are engaging with. But yes, I think there is a need to have this
      conversation and I hope as a team, we are able to understand this better moving
      forward. \n\n### What do you think works the most to stop people from sharing
      misinformation and build a culture of verifying information - stories, videos
      or broader interventions like media literacy?\n\nEven if we can develop a habit
      of asking what is the source of the information, I think we will go a long way.
      When I joined WebQoof, I had fears of how I would be able to do it and identify
      misinformation. We are taught tools, but verifying content does not come instantly.
      The biggest lesson I taught myself was to question the source. If you know where
      the claim is coming from, you can go ahead and verify that. \n\nCreating awareness
      about being able to verify and to forward suspicious content to fact-checkers
      is important. \n\nIn terms of format, videos travel faster and they travel more.
      At WebQoof we produce a lot of videos, including video explainers. \n\n### How
      has been your experience of using Check? What else would you like the tool to
      do for you?\n\nThe experience has been good so far. I really like that we now
      have data on how many people are engaging with the bot and resources. This is
      a good way to know how useful it is. \n\nShalini and Pierre initially told us
      that it is important to sometimes engage with the reader. As quereis have gone
      up, that does not happen often. We intend to do that more often. When requests
      are out of scope for fact-check, we inform the user and ask them to send any
      forwards which they are doubtful of. This engagement helps in  building trust. \n\nAll
      the constant feedback in weekly calls really helps. Initially, I was not sure
      of the weekly calls. But they have been extremely good at raising issues and
      streamlining the process. \n\nWe have requested for a feature to know once a
      user receives a report we sent, in other words a confirmation. We hope to see
      that soon. (This feature has been implemented by Meedan since this interview
      was held).\n\nConstant feedback and communication are really helpful. Intercom
      is also helpful to immediately flag the issue.  After a day I may not remember
      it or will not have the link of the item. If I send the issue and the URL of
      the item, I know that I will receive a response in some time. \n\n### What kind
      of misinformation do you foresee in the post-covid world? What support do you
      expect from international fact-check communities and technology partners like
      us?\n\nAccess to more data about the kind of work we are doing is an expectation
      that I have from all technology partners. And probably, not just our work but
      the impact that fact-checking community has had will be good to understand.
      In my opinion, that will help in shaping our future goals (as a community). \n\nWe
      work with Facebook, Meedan and I think it will be helpful to know if our efforts
      of combating misinformation are translating into action. Insights on whether
      people are engaging more with fact-checked content, whether they want more verified
      news and what is the level of trust they have in fact-checkers. These will be
      very helpful going forward. \n\n### What is your vision and hopes for journalism
      and the world in a post- pandemic world?\n\nI wish we have days where we look
      for misinformation and do not find them. Even if I can't wish for a world without
      misinformation, I definitely hope that people verify information before they
      share it. \n\nMy hope for journalism is that mainstream media becomes more responsible.
      There needs to be more responsibility and accountability for information that
      media groups put out. It is important because [misinformation has real life
      consequences](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/impact-of-fake-news-on-lives-of-people-in-2019). \n\nWhen
      they publish unverified information, it creates a narrative that sometimes becomes
      difficult to verify or disprove. If something is unverifiable and just a narrative
      that has been weaved, I may not be able to touch it or put out a story on it
      or tell people whether it is true or not. When news is unverifiable, it tends
      to create a parallel narrative. This can result in hate speech and violence. \n\nPeople
      need to verify, be alert and if they cannot verify, send it to us. \n\n### What
      are your interests outside of work?\n\nI like reading, but that is something
      every journalist does. I love cycling, doodling and eating a lot.\n\n--\n\n<p

    body: "Today’s world has more internet users than people with access to essential
      health services such as primary care, dental care, or surgery. We’ve reached
      700,000 of them across 18 countries, but so much more remains to be done. \n\nMeedan’s
      Digital Health Lab team have created a B2B fact-checking model for health content
      based on syndication. We are testing a hypothesis that a rapid-response process
      where a team of health experts distill scientific evidence based on requests
      made by fact-checkers—requests that other communciators around the world may
      also have— we can meet the needs of audiences searching for health information
      online more efficiently, at larger scales, across regions, and directly where
      searching takes place. \n\nHere are our top-level highlights:\n\n- Our incredible
      team of experts __successfully responds to requests__ for contextualizing the
      scientific research __in as little as 3 hours__\n- Our process has successfully
      reached an audience of __over 700,000 people across Asia, Latin America, Africa,
      Europe and North America__, with localization of both text and accompanying
      visuals (thanks, to [Students Against COVID-19](https://www.studentsagainstcovid-19.com/)
      and [Localization Lab](https://www.localizationlab.org/)) __in 8 languages__
      prioritized by our partners \n- The __public health community__, including health
      literacy practitioners, __is eager and excited to get more involved__ in supporting
      local misinformation response efforts\n\n![meedan covid-19-db-usage-reuters](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/4xgsZVcR02vLjnusBejbyo/189a7297d4d3b38964e5219f5af26ee4/meedan_covid-19-db-usage-reuters.jpg)\n<p
      class=\"caption\">Reporting done by Reuters about herd immunity and COVID-19
      using Meedan Digital Health Lab's COVID-19 Expert Database content.</p>\n\nThrough
      the COVID-19 pandemic, online information searches serve as a supplement to
      reduced availability and accessibility of in-person healthcare. This coincides
      with public health authorities realizing the important role that trusted fact-checking
      organizations with strong community ties play in minimizing the impact of health
      misinformation, especially during a pandemic. At a presentation our team participated
      in about health misinformation hosted by the [National Academies of Science,
      Engineering and Medicine](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/addressing-health-misinformation-through-health-literacy-practices-a-workshop),
      health fact-checking was identified as “the next frontier of health literacy”,
      and, thanks to generous support from the Omidyar Foundation, Google, and the
      Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Meedan’s [Digital Health Lab gets to contribute](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf)
      to the development of this new frontier. \n\nOver the last year and a half Meedan’s
      Digital Health Lab has been developing and deploying a __rapid-response framework
      for supporting fact-checking organizations, journalists and other community
      information leaders__ that are working to address health misinformation online
      across literacy levels and languages. In addition to rapid response, we collaborate
      with behavior scientists, fact-checking organizations to design workshops and
      educational modules to strengthen the efficaciousness of health misinformation
      response efforts. \n\nOur COVID-19 rapid response, the [COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/),
      is focused on: \n- Collecting critical pandemic-related queries directly from
      fact-checking organizations, community newsrooms and other community information
      leaders\n- Triaging COVID-19 content to send to team members with specific public
      health expertise to provide standardized responses\n- Designing visuals to address
      disparities in health literacy\n- Conducting behavior science, machine learning
      and rigorous user research to strengthen this rapid-response process as a replicable
      and scalable framework \n\nThrough __three 48-hour weekly editorial sprints__,
      as well as 3-hour turnarounds for urgent requests, the content produced by the
      Digital Health Lab’s COVID-19 Expert DB & Toolkit has served three major purposes:
      as a reliable source of information relating to rapidly evolving science; providing
      explanations surrounding conflicting evidence and treatment recommendations;
      sharing recommended additional resources for fact-checking organizations and
      journalists to review as they produce the information their communities need.

      health expertise\n\nIn the digital health information ecosystem, building direct
      communication channels involves developing interventions where target audiences
      spend time finding answers to the health questions they have, which today means
      content easily encountered through searches online and through social media.
      Of course, as any one organization, this is really challenging to achieve. \n\nDuring
      this project, we developed a process we call B2B fact-checking: we help the
      fact-checkers fact-check. It was our hope that by building a model based on
      syndication, fact-checkers, journalists and other community information leaders
      can use the content we create directly for them *__as well as__* the content
      we have developed in response to questions shared by other communicators. With
      this model, we can provide the needed health expertise to reduce health misinformation
      more efficiently, at larger scales, and directly where a users’ searching takes
      place. \n\n![meedan covid-19-db-usage-verafiles](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/6vvZJnxxFjGSYprr9KVRM1/ea482f948fb66bbee0fb7760fdfd34f5/meedan_covid-19-db-usage-verafiles.jpg)\n<p

      class=\"caption\">Health communications organization Nigeria Health Watch uses
      Digital Health Lab's COVID-19 Expert Database content to respond to health misinformation
      topics that emerge in countries all over the world, with a localized response
      focus.</p>\n\nOur research with these users has demonstrated how having access
      to experts can increase the subject matter that fact-checkers can cover, and
      therefore the content available online to the fact-checkers’ audiences. The
      examples of where our collaboration with partners in different parts of the
      world have led to first item or first-page search results on Google highlight
      the impact that smaller health organizations can have on influencing the discourse
      online when we can support the work of fact-checkers directly.\n\n### Data sprints
      for the triple bottom line: Substance, Syndication and Speed\n\nOne of the biggest
      challenges of achieving impact at the scale of the internet is moving at the
      speed of the internet. We studied design sprint methodologies from Agile, Google
      Design, and others to create what we call a Data Sprint: a rapid-response framework
      that ensures the triple bottom line of substantive, quality content; syndicated,
      networked impact; and speedy, responsive turnaround times.\n\n__Substance:__
      To date, a small team of scientists with expertise across infectious disease,
      nutritional epidemiology, pandemic preparedness, vaccine adoption and health
      behavior change have created over 110, 500-word science articles over 20 weeks.
      Each article or database ‘entry’ responds  to questions submitted by fact-checkers
      and journalists, with additional information to further distill  each topic’s
      historical and scientific significance for health communicators. \n\nThis impact
      will soon be magnified through a collaboration with Localization Lab, targeting
      8 languages prioritized by our current partners. We are currently working with
      SciLine to expand the global reach of the resources that they have created by
      including them in the short articles we produce for our partners. \n\n__Syndication:__
      Through the syndication model developed for this project, our partners have
      identified an audience of over 700,000 people in more than 18 countries across
      Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe and North America. This audience includes
      podcast listeners, website visitors and newsletter subscribers, and does not
      include the social media followings of our partner organizations. This level
      of impact was made possible through our syndication model for content dissemination,
      enabling a small team of scientists, researchers and communicators to influence
      diverse information spaces.\n\n__Speed:__ The turnaround time for the content
      we produce is 48 hours or less, following the tight editorial cycles of our
      journalism partners. Responses are often created in as few as 5 hours by team
      members on-call to meet urgent partner deadlines. This rapid response directly
      targets midinformation: misunderstandings, misinterpretations and misrepresentations
      based on scant or emerging scientific evidence. Midinformation happens often
      when expert consensus changes over time, and it is distinct from more straightforward
      misinformation. \n\nWe apply principles from Google’s Design Sprint methodology
      into three weekly sprints, including problem mapping and prioritization, solution
      sketching across text and visual responses, and feedback integration from partners.
      Through consistent use of this model, we are able to optimize for the number
      of requests we can address weekly, and can account for responding to a diverse
      set of topics that require reviewing extensive scientific literature across
      a variety of disciplines. \n\n### Key lessons our team has learned over the
      last 6 months\n\nAs a team, we have distilled four key lessons to carry our
      project strategy forward: \n\n1. __It is important to educate health professionals
      about the value of existing approaches being taken by platforms to reduce the
      impact of misinformation.__ Influencing impacts of health misinformation at
      scale requires closer connections between health scientists and communicators
      using tools already optimized for easy online encounters with factual health
      information, such as Google’s ClaimReview and MediaReview annotation frameworks,,
      and partnerships with third-party fact-checking organizations. The health community
      is ready and excited to contribute to projects like this one, and needs guidance
      about where time and effort is best spent.  \n\n2. __Syndication models can
      maximize impact at the scale of the internet.__ Our partnerships with e-newsletters,
      podcasts, communicators with their own syndication models, and collaborations
      with fact-checking organizations and newsrooms have reached over 700,000 people
      in just three months of collaboration. Our goal is to continue supporting communicators
      with their own content development, know that while we can distill the ever-changing
      science successfully, community information leaders know their audiences best,
      and that maximizes the impact of any public health message.  \n\n3. __A focus
      is needed on misinformation related to both vaccines and treatment.__ While
      these represent the majority of the questions shared with us by fact-checkers
      and journalists, the most common questions are not reflected in resources provided
      by intergovernmental or government health institutions. Further, while current
      public health officials estimate that a successful vaccine will be developed
      by the end of 2020 and that vaccination campaigns will start by early 2021,
      a vaccination campaigns’ success is determined by people’s willingness to get
      vaccinated. Patterns in uneven distribution of vaccines globally, and thus uneven
      eradication of certain illnesses, will likely yield inequalities in the elimination
      of COVID-19 in different parts of the world. For this reason, it is essential
      to not only address vaccine misinformation, but also misinformation associated
      with COVID-19 treatments, which may emerge in successful forms earlier than
      the release of a vaccine.\n\n4. __Localization conducted by various stakeholders
      is required to reach & be accessible to community information leaders at a global
      scale.__ Our partners have requested that local health experts, as well as users,
      combine efforts to translate the database content and accompanying visuals into
      local languages. We're grateful to the Localization Lab, and to our public health
      expert translator team, for making this novel approach at localization possible!
      This optimizes for accessibility (including factors related to availability,
      relevance, and literacy), and ensures that fact-checkers and journalists operating
      in diverse languages can all benefit from, and contribute to, improved health
      literacy where their audiences already seek content.  \n\n### What’s next: expanding
      and diversifying our impact\n\nWith these lessons in mind, here’s what’s next
      for our team: \n\n__Expanding scope of response effort:__ Our experts have provided
      contextualization for over 120 topics related to COVID-19, moving at a rate
      of, on average, 10 database articles or “entries” per week. Our collaborators
      are increasingly asking questions about public health topics significant with
      respect to the pandemic, but are distinctly relevant outside of COVID-19. These
      include questions about nutrition, non-communicable diseases, antibiotic resistance
      and reproductive health. Our goal is to provide additional public health expert
      contextualizations for topics outside of COVID-19.  \n\n__Engaging with community-based
      communications networks:__ Our goal is to expand our offerings with a focus
      on rapid responses for community newsrooms, freelance journalists, community
      \ nonprofits and other information leaders within communities. In collaboration
      with our partners, we’re working with the product and development teams at Meedan
      to create more efficient pathways of information-sharing between our experts
      and community information leaders, using dedicated helplines through SMS, WhatsApp,
      Facebook and Twitter. We’re also sharing customizable bot infrastructure so
      community newsrooms can more easily connect their audiences with the health
      information that is directly relevant to their needs. We hope to support these
      groups directly by providing the information that they can tailor to the needs
      of their own communities that they know best. \n\n__Strengthening relationships
      between public health experts, the health literacy community, local newsrooms
      and fact-checking organizations:__ Given the important role community newsrooms
      and fact-checking organizations play in responding to health misinformation
      via social media and online search platforms, integrating more closely with
      the public health community can serve to strengthen health literacy at scales
      larger than ever before. \n\nTo learn more about work, please contact <a href=\"mailto:health@meedan.com\">health@meedan.com</a>.

    body: "The COVID-19 pandemic sent rumour mills into a frenzy. The World Health
      Organization described it as a massive infodemic, capable of drowning out reliable
      health guidance in an over-abundance of opinion. From Argentina to South Africa
      we came across new home made remedies about steam and salt water, and long-debunked
      allegations about vaccinations. \n\nBut as fact-checkers know all too well,
      health misinformation is not a peculiarity of the 2020s. From rumours in Northern
      Nigeria about polio vaccinations almost two decades ago, to the more recent
      allegations that Zika and Ebola were made by humans, there is a long history
      of health misinformation - in times of crises, but also in the everyday. We
      all carry a myth passed down to us by a friend or family member in the name
      of tradition, beauty, or propriety.\n\nThis year at Global Fact, we (Olivia
      Vicol, Full Fact; Nat Gyenes, Meedan Digital Health Lab; Eric Mugendi, PesaCheck,
      and Dr. Theresa Amobi, University of Lagos) brought our reviews of academic
      evidence in conversation with fact checkers, with a view to expand upon best
      practices for fact-checking Health Misinformation. We took main lessons from
      psychology and health communication, and nuanced them with the insights of over
      30 fact checkers, journalists, and academics in attendance. The goal was simple:
      develop a standard of care for health misinformation.\n\n![Global-Fact-7 brainstorm-on-misinformation](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/1nHZhDB5dfrywS72JmodER/08d3cdce677407f39b763e4ff8196716/Global-Fact-7_brainstorm-on-misinformation.png)\n<p
      class=\"caption\">Here is some of what participants brainstormed together during
      the health misinformation workshop at Global Fact 7.</p>\n\n### Production\n\n__If
      a rumour is already in public debate, fact check it early to prevent it from
      getting traction through repetition.__ Ever since the 1940s psychologists have
      found that repetition contributes to belief. Our default is to trust, and in
      times of crisis in particular we tend to remember the first explanations we
      come across.\n\n__But don’t give more oxygen to myths which would otherwise
      have remained unknown.__ Fact checking is key to the extent that it stops posts
      rated as false from traveling further on social media. But think about whether
      every claim intercepted this way is worth publicising further. Publicising every
      fact check on claims doubting the safety of the flu vaccine, for instance, can
      unintentionally give those claims much more exposure than if they had just been
      rated as false on social media. This exposure matters, because seeing something
      in the public domain can lead audiences to believe that the safety of the vaccine
      is doubted by a lot more people than it reality is. Social Norms Theory tells
      us that what we think is happening in society is a better predictor of our behaviors
      than what is actually happening. Our health decisions and behaviors may be predicated
      more on our perceptions of what dominant social norms are rather than what they
      actually are. \n\n__Talk with public health experts__ where possible to determine
      whether it is necessary to either a) fact check early, to prevent claims from
      getting traction through repetition, or b) practice strategic silence.  And
      remember that public health experts are also a source of trust. In times of
      uncertainty when rumours abound, including trusted public health experts in
      the content and dissemination of a fact check, can help good information stand
      out from the noise. \n\n__Publish the sources of your information, and the last
      time they were updated, to account for rapidly changing information.__ As global
      health scientist and vaccine uptake specialist Nour Sharara phrased it, “science
      is the truth of today”. This is an especially important concept in constantly
      changing health emergencies where treatments and public health guidelines shift
      based on the latest evidence. As much as you can communicate the fact that if
      something changes in a health context, it is actually a good thing, because
      it means that the public health community has stronger evidence to point towards
      a more informed health policy decision.  \n\n### Headlines\n\n__Phrase your
      headlines as answers, not questions.__ In a time of incidental media consumption,
      headlines are often the only thing the public see. Simply phrasing a headline
      as a question risks having readers remember the inaccurate claim, instead of
      the debunk. This doesn’t just apply to health misinformation. It also applied
      to fact-checking more generally, and is of particular importance when the consequence
      of a fact-check might be a change or modification in a health behavior.   \n\n###
      Content\n\n__Don’t stop at saying what’s wrong.__ Tell the public what is right
      and why. The need to have an explanation for what happens and feel in control
      in our environment is part of human nature. Some of us find these explanations
      in science, religion, or in personal experience - but there is always a why.
      Simply telling the public that something they know is wrong, without updating
      their model of events, can make it easy to fall back on past knowledge. Fill
      that gap. Clearly state what is wrong, but also tell your audience what is right
      and why. For health misinformation, finding resources that can assist with contextualizing
      the topic that you might be fact-checking within the larger body of health research
      can make this process easier. Participants in this workshop emphasized the importance
      of building strong collaborations and projects directly with reliable health
      researchers for this to be as effective as possible. \n\n__Keep unnecessary
      details to a minimum.__ No one has unlimited attention - and processing complex
      information is particularly difficult in times of crisis, when readers are likely
      to be experiencing stress. Make sure that the context and imagery you include
      in your fact checks are necessary to your debunk. Remember that moving images
      (like gifs, videos, and sidebar adverts) are particularly distracting. If your
      fact check includes those details, ask yourself what they add to the public’s
      understanding of the story.\n\n### Imagery\n\n__Don’t use graphic imagery that
      may trigger fear or disgust__ of blood and needles. A study which looked at
      vaccine hesitancy around the world found that many people who experience this
      attitude towards vaccines are also disgusted by needles and blood. We haven’t
      come across research that looks specifically at how graphic imagery shapes the
      interpretation of health fact checks. But until we do, it seems wise to not
      make a case for vaccination, using the imagery associated with fear of it.\n\n###
      Tone & Audience Engagement\n\n__Emphasise high safety, not low risk.__ Research
      reviewed by the WHO indicates that different framings of the same fact can lead
      to very different risk perceptions and behaviours. Focusing on the positive
      effects of an intervention, may be more effective than focusing on the absence
      of negative effects. Think of the difference between saying: vaccines save 3
      million lives a year, and saying: only a very small number of people develop
      side effects.\n\n__Don’t ridicule the claim.__ Provide a safe space for individuals
      seeking health information or wanting to ask questions about health myths or
      beliefs. It is essential for audiences to feel comfortable seeking information
      that might correct long-standing beliefs related to their health or that of
      family members - a deeply personal and important issue for us all. It’s essential
      that, as a community of health information responders, we don’t use words like
      “crazy” or “outlandish” to describe the myths that we correct. We need to reduce
      the stigma of health information-seeking.  Further, even a completely inaccurate
      health claim might have been shared with good intentions. It may have profound
      cultural or religious implications. And most importantly, we don’t have any
      evidence that humour is a more effective way of countering health misinformation
      than a neutral, facts-based piece.\n\n\n____\n\nFor more information about research

    updates: "__Foreword__\n\nWritten by Peter Cunliffe-Jones \n\nWhen voters believe
      false information about political events, they often have only one opportunity
      every few years to act on it, and consequences can be hard to judge. When the
      false information concerns health treatments or the conditions that cause a
      disease to spread, the chances to act misguidedly can be unlimited and the consequences
      can be life or death.\nWhen the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) agreed
      last year to review our Code of Principles, we agreed the code should provide
      a floor, not a ceiling, to standards in our field. In March 2020, the new and
      updated code came into practice, agreed by IFCN signatories to subject our work
      to assessment on the basis of a new raft of standards on methodology and use
      of sources.\n\nThat is the floor. The IFCN of course wants our community to
      always find ways to improve, and in no field does this matter more than health
      misinformation – the topic that first fired my own interest in misinformation
      almost two decades ago. Therefore we welcome this initiative to propose a set
      of best practices for how we as fact-checkers can respond to health misinformation
      both effectively, and safely, a standard of care, if you will, for those we
      serve: our readers, viewers or listeners.\n\nThese proposed best practices are
      simply that. They are not part of the IFCN Code but were developed following
      discussions at Global Fact 7, and we hope that fact-checkers everywhere will
      find ways to review, consider and perhaps improve on them – reaching always
      to improve the important work we do."

    body: "A few weeks ago, in a WhatsApp message group with family members, a forwarded
      message showed up on my screen that read: “The COVID-19 plot thickens, please
      do read.” \n \nIn India, where my family is from, it is typical for a day to
      begin with five or more messages in different family or work WhatsApp groups.
      The messages range from friendly updates and innocent gifs to threads pressuring
      you to forward messages to nine people in order to avoid ill-fated planetary
      alignments.\n \nWhat followed the COVID-19 message a few weeks ago was an elaborate
      thread containing false claims about COVID-19 as a lab-made virus, intended
      to boost the sales of Remdesivir and benefit Bill Gates and George Soros. The
      forwarded text falsely claimed that the entire COVID-19 crisis is a well-orchestrated
      effort at the highest levels by Gates, Soros, Obama, and Clinton to develop
      a COVID-19 vaccine, with “the ultimate motivation of making billions of dollars
      in profits at the cost of only losing a mere million human lives.” This particular
      conspiracy theory was disseminated on Facebook in the United States, and quickly
      spread through WhatsApp in India as well.\n \nIn the United States, journalists
      are battling misinformation on open or partially open social platforms like
      Facebook and Twitter. In India, as in other parts of the world, the problem
      may be trickier to catch—and harder to prevent, because misinformation spreads
      predominantly in closed chat groups on WhatsApp, away from the sights of content
      moderators and fact-checkers.  Blatant misinformation campaigns like the one
      I received recently are dangerous under normal circumstances, and downright
      deadly in the midst of a pandemic. Misinformation makes it harder for healthcare
      authorities to effectively communicate critical health information to wider
      audiences.\n \nWhatsApp misinformation in India sows distrust in healthcare
      institutions and encourages disregard for basic public health advice. Often
      disguised as medical advice, doctored videos of a prominent Indian doctor advising
      viewers not to get tested for coronavirus were circulated over 5,000 times on
      Facebook and Twitter. False rumors have led to many Indian doctors and frontline
      healthcare workers being evicted from their homes. This is especially important
      in the Indian context, where unfiltered and inaccurate information spreads rapidly
      on WhatsApp, and can quickly hamper efforts to trace, isolate, and care for
      COVID cases. Healthcare workers attempting to stop the spread of COVID-19 have
      been attacked by mobs across India as recently as April, and misinformation
      has only exacerbated the violence.\n \nIn March 2020, one particular message
      circulating on WhatsApp caught the attention of the Government of India’s Press
      Information Bureau (PIB). The message falsely claimed that the Government was
      spraying “CV vaccine gas inside the country, through airplanes.”\n \nThe official
      Twitter account of PIB (@PIBFactCheck) responded by stating: “Amidst #Coronavirusoutbreak,
      misinformation on CV Vaccine gas spread out through Airplanes is circulating
      on social media. NO such action has been planned out by the Indian Government.
      Get your facts from trusted sources. Do not amplify #fakenews!”\n \nAge-old
      rumors about vaccine safety are now being tailored to COVID-19 audiences to
      promote vaccine hesitancy, which could derail efforts not only for the eventual
      implementation of a COVID-19 vaccine, but also for the continuation of routine
      vaccinations for myriad other diseases.\n \nThe misinformation amid the pandemic
      is not limited to vaccine hesitancy. In some  parts of India, the indigenous
      cow has been elevated to new heights and questionable treatments, such as cow
      urine, have been marketed as an effective remedy against the novel coronavirus.
      Such claims may have gained legitimacy under the current Government, which created
      an open call for research & development proposals that examine dubious pseudo-scientific
      treatments such as “cowpathy” for “medicine and health” in February this year.
      In such circumstances, it becomes even more difficult to distinguish science
      from pseudoscience in a pandemic, especially as misinformation seems to travel
      even faster than COVID-19 in India.\n \nIn Mizoram, approximately 15 individuals
      were arrested for spreading a fictitious and official-sounding directive from
      state officials, asking local citizens from outside Mizoram to return home at
      once. Similar arrests have taken place in Rajasthan, Odisha, and other Indian
      states. Successive state governments have responded to misinformation by conducting
      mass arrests rather than tackling the problem at its root by improving health
      communication in localized languages.\n \nEffective health communication in
      a pandemic requires systematic investments in health infrastructure and adequate
      training for academics and journalists. Fortunately, many organizations are
      meeting this gap and providing resources and responses to tackle such misinformation.
      Organizations such as SciLine, the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN),
      and COVID Explained have developed several resources, unpacking claims about
      COVID-19. While many such projects focus on general misinformation related to
      COVID-19, there is an increased need for addressing vaccine misinformation specifically,
      and to provide the context needed for individuals that speak a variety of different
      languages, with varying health literacy levels.\n  \nThere is a paucity of evidence-based
      information for journalists, fact-checkers and everyday WhatsApp users to effectively
      unpack disingenuous claims, whether it be anti-vaccine propaganda or the marketing
      of natural and herbal remedies as cures for the coronavirus.\n \nIndia has detected
      1.2 million cases and 30,000 deaths of COVID-19, according to the Ministry of
      Health & Family Welfare. Given the difficulties around active surveillance in
      India, experts believe the actual number could be even higher. Even if official
      estimates are to be believed, however, the contagion of misinformation threatens
      to derail existing efforts and present roadblocks to the development of a future
      vaccine.\n \nIt is now more imperative than ever before to prioritize effective
      health communication in order to tackle the scourge of misinformation, especially
      as we double down on efforts to rein in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n \n*Mohit Nair

    body: "The proliferation of misinformation and disinformation online throughout
      the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly yielded a corresponding ‘infodemic.’ Information
      around the novel coronavirus is shifting daily and narratives vary based on
      the contexts in which we live, work and socialize.  \n\nThis creates a near-perfect
      recipe for a confusing, substandard information ecosystem and intentionally
      false information. Mis- and disinformation related to the pandemic is not just
      \ harmful for individuals, but, because of the nature of the virus, low-quality
      information also adversely impacts the collective and directly contributes to
      greater numbers of cases and deaths. \n\nAs both a graduate student pursuing
      an MPH at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and as a young person
      raised in the American South, I’ve had a lens into two contrasting sides of
      the COVID-19 online informational arena. On the one hand, I have access to some
      of the highest-quality and timely information on the pandemic. On the other,
      I have a lens into American skepticism of the CDC and WHO, and clear gaps in
      which  public health authorities  (such as from Harvard Chan, the CDC, and WHO
      themselves), are not effectively reaching the general public, particularly in
      the digital realm. \n\nMisinformation is highly challenging to regulate, often
      because it spreads  informally across a range of social media platforms. Evidence
      shows that traditional public health interventions on social media, which present
      text-heavy facts on platforms, are inadequate for obtaining wide-reach. This
      becomes particularly clear when those interventions are compared to the reach
      of mis- and disinformation. Exacerbating this challenge is the fact that news
      sources are often not staffed with in-house public health experts, and given
      that, there are significant bottlenecks within academia that preclude a free-flowing
      stream of the most up-to-date health information for journalists.\n\nIn order
      to address this set of challenges, student group Students Against COVID-19 (SAC)
      and [Meedan's COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/) are
      partnering to pair the latest expert health information with digestible infographics
      tailored to online spaces and resharing. Through the partnership, SAC will leverage
      the Meedan Digital Health Lab’s team of experts to translate their most recent
      COVID-19 updates and answers to pressing questions into highly accessible visuals
      particularly intended for online audiences globally. Graphics will be posted
      alongside expert answers on the [learnaboutcovid19.org](http://learnaboutcovid19.org/)
      database for easy viewing and sharing. This pairing of content and visuals has
      the potential for broad impact in mitigating health misinformation online and,
      in turn, improved public health outcomes. \n\n![Zoonotic Diseases](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3hzT12rbPNOOF4inKiGxzp/763ba6cb8a26539ddcd96eebb4e9adaa/Screen_Shot_2020-06-26_at_2.56.45_PM.png)!

    body: "Last week I was fortunate to receive corrective surgery on my disabled
      arm, a remnant of an injury from over 9 months ago. When the COVID-19 pandemic
      hit, changing all of our plans, it understandably delayed non-essential medical
      procedures like the one I needed.\n \nJuly 2020 marks [30 years since the passage
      of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/30th_anniversary/index.html).
      Twelve years ago the [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
      (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html)
      came into effect, which was the first United Nations (UN) human rights treaty
      of the 21st century, and also the UN convention with the largest number of signatories
      in history on its opening day.  \n\nAs I recover, I am reflecting on what these
      mean for my friends and colleagues with disabilities, including disabilities
      that are permanent or longer-term than my own. \n\nWe have made progress through
      high-level decisions and cultural shifts. For example, plans for people with
      disabilities are now included in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, the
      Paris Agreement on Global Climate Change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster
      Risk Reduction, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development.
      Yet there is much more to do  – we still have not achieved universal access,
      and people with disabilities are being disproportionately affected by the COVID-19
      pandemic in multiple ways.\n\n- People with disabilities are at a higher risk
      of severe symptoms and death from COVID-19. A [study published in the *Disability
      and Health Journal*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245650/)
      found that there is a higher COVID-19 fatality rate among people with intellectual
      and developmental disabilities (IDD). The researchers also found a higher concentration
      of COVID-19 cases at younger ages for people with IDD. Last month, the American
      Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) shared [devastating statistics](https://www.aclu.org/news/disability-rights/covid-19-deaths-in-nursing-homes-are-not-unavoidable-they-are-the-result-of-deadly-discrimination/)
      on the anniversary of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v.
      L.C., which recognized that unjustified segregation of people with disabilities
      is a form of discrimination: Nearly 50% of COVID-19 deaths have been among people
      living in nursing homes, psychiatric hospitals, and other congregate settings
      for people with disabilities, while this population only makes up less than
      1% of the U.S. population. The ACLU warns us that these excess and inequitable
      deaths are “not unavoidable – they are the result of deadly discrimination.”\n\n-
      People with disabilities are also excluded as much of our world moves online
      during the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting everything from education and employment
      to essential services and social connection. There is [growing worldwide concern](https://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=2322)
      about the digital divide, where many people still lack access to technologies
      like computers and smartphones, not to mention affordable as well as reliable
      internet and even electricity. The most affected tend to be [lower-income](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/07/digital-divide-persists-even-as-lower-income-americans-make-gains-in-tech-adoption/),
      [older generations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/technology/virus-older-generation-digital-divide.html),
      [racial and ethnic minorities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/20/smartphones-help-blacks-hispanics-bridge-some-but-not-all-digital-gaps-with-whites/),
      [sexual and gender minorities](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/GenderDigital/HRBDT_submission.pdf),
      and [people with disabilities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/07/disabled-americans-are-less-likely-to-use-technology/),
      with many intersectionalities. Exacerbating this, people with disabilities can
      face additional barriers, such as:\n\n\n1.   Increased risks of online harassment
      and discrimination\n\n2.   Lack of adaptations for limited abilities to see,
      hear, and understand content\n\n3.  Lack of adaptations for limited physical
      abilities to use devices (ex.    following my injury, I learned to type using
      one hand supplemented with voice recognition software)\n\nIt is more crucial
      than ever to mitigate barriers like these during a pandemic, where online access
      to quality information and essential activities can directly influence health
      outcomes.\n\nHere at Meedan, the Digital Health Lab is working to address “viral
      misinformation that facilitates the spread of a particular health outcome or
      disease,” also called a “misinfodemic,” by increasing access to expert-sourced
      information about COVID-19. \n\nMeedan’s efforts to increase access include
      avoiding jargon to make information readable by the general public, providing
      a glossary with simplified definitions of scientific terms, translating information
      for non-English speakers, and disseminating information across diverse media
      channels. In this process, we cannot forget to include people with disabilities.
      Leaving out people with disabilities means hurting a significant proportion
      of humanity: The World Health Organization (WHO) [estimates that over 1 billion](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health)
      people experience some form of disability. Additionally, the ADA and CRPD require
      making online content, services, and systems accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nEquality
      under the law does not automatically translate to equity in everyday practice.
      We have to do the hard work of building the inclusive world we’d like to see,
      and we need to continuously work on addressing ableism and centering disability
      justice. Meedan’s Digital Health Lab is striving to increase access to COVID-19
      information for all, including people with disabilities, and we invite you to
      join us.\n\nResources:\n\n[ADA Best Practices Chapter 5 Website Accessibility](https://www.ada.gov/pcatoolkit/chap5toolkit.htm)\n[Federal

    body: "Breastfeeding promotes early childhood cognitive development, prevents
      young child infections including pneumonia and diarrhea, and improves mental
      and physical health in mothers. That’s why each year during the first week of
      August, [World Breastfeeding Week](https://worldbreastfeedingweek.org) is celebrated
      to raise awareness and promote breastfeeding as the best source of nutrition
      for most babies. \n\nGeneral breastfeeding guidance from the World Health Organization
      (WHO) and other leading health authorities includes breastfeeding for the first
      six months of life all the way to two years of age and beyond.\n\nUnfortunately,
      misinformation about breastfeeding is widespread. Claims often center around:\n\n-
      Foods breastfeeding mothers should or should not eat (In general, [breastfeeding
      moms](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/diet-and-micronutrients/maternal-diet.html)
      should eat a varied diet and don’t need to include or avoid specific foods except
      for some seafood that may be high in mercury.)\n\n- If exercise changes the
      taste of breastmilk ([Exercise](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      is healthy and has not been shown to change the taste of breastmilk.)\n\n- Whether
      negative emotions affect breastmilk quality (Breastmilk quality [doesn’t change](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      based on mom’s emotions.)\n\n- Whether it is okay for a mother to breastfeed
      if she is ill ([In most cases](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding),
      moms should continue to breastfeed even when they’re ill because breastmilk
      passes on immune defense to the baby, but there are some exceptions so always
      check with your or your baby’s doctor.)\n \nExacerbating the issue, early in
      the coronavirus pandemic incomplete scientific consensus and confusion resulted
      in brand new types of breastfeeding [misinformation](https://www.iol.co.za/lifestyle/family/baby/covid-19-moms-and-breastfeeding-separating-facts-from-fiction-add70b6c-9821-4471-8297-67e69947c5b1).
      Because little was known about the virus, many feared that the virus would spread
      from mothers to their infants through [breastmilk](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      and those concerns were shared widely in online communities. \n\nOffline challenges
      of COVID-19 have also taken hold. Lockdown limits access to pre- and postnatal
      lactation support [services](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
      leaving mothers vulnerable to online or familial misinformation in the absence
      of professional breastfeeding support. Some women have been [advised](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036629/)
      by doctors not to breastfeed or to stop breastfeeding. \n\nIn some cases, babies
      [were](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
      separated from mothers in hospitals, a practice known to make establishing breastfeeding
      [difficult](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html),
      decrease breastfeeding [success](https://trends.hms.harvard.edu/2020/03/31/covid-19-separating-infected-mothers-from-newborns-weighing-the-risks-and-benefits/),
      inhibit [early bonding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27885658/) and attachment,
      and [negatively impact maternal mental health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842365/).
      Finally, some reports have also suggested that formula companies began further
      undermining breastfeeding messages by promoting formula as safer than breastmilk
      during the pandemic.\n \nNow, eight months into the pandemic, we have improved
      understanding and data, so breastfeeding recommendations for mothers infected
      with COVID-19 are clearer. Despite misinformation, while studies of breastmilk
      and breastfeeding are ongoing, current research shows that the risk of an infant
      becoming infected with COVID-19 through breast milk is low. \nThe WHO [suggests](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      that “at this point, it appears that COVID-19 in infants and children represents
      a much lower threat to survival and health than other infections that breastfeeding
      is protective against.” Meanwhile the threat of poor health outcomes as a result
      of not breastfeeding is [particularly true](https://www.bfmed.org/assets/DOCUMENTS/abm-position-breastfeeding.pdf)
      in areas where access to clean water and medical care are limited.\n \nFor those
      on the front lines who are supporting moms and babies everyday, providing encouragement,
      addressing misinformation, and empowering mothers to make well-informed feeding
      decisions, are a huge part of providing high-quality care. While babies are
      not immune from contracting COVID-19, based on the current evidence the WHO
      advises that even with suspected or confirmed maternal COVID-19, breastfeeding
      is recommended for infants and young children. The U.S. Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention further advise mothers to further discuss breastfeeding
      with their healthcare providers.\n \nResources:\n[World Alliance for Breastfeeding.
