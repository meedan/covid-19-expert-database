    body: "On Thursday, Oct. 1, U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania
      Trump reported positive diagnoses of COVID-19. The story is still developing,
      and a lot of information—both scientific and political—is still unknown. Meedan’s
      team of in-house public health experts at learnaboutcovid19.org have explainers
      that can help support your reporting on this breaking news event. We’ll update
      this with more resources as more information becomes available and clear.\n\n####
      [How many days after exposure should one be tested to yield the most accurate
      results, and with which test?](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/how-many-days-after-exposure-should-one-be-tested-to-yield-the-most-accurate-results-and-with-which-test/)\n\nOn
      Oct. 2, 2020 press reported that former Vice President and presidential hopeful
      Joe Biden tested negative for COVID-19 after his exposure to President Trump
      during the first 2020 presidential debate on Sept. 29, 2020. Research suggests
      that diagnostic testing is more accurate a few days after symptoms start, or
      around a week after exposure to a person who is infected with COVID-19. Testing
      more than once can also confirm negative results. Testing Vice President Biden
      more than once would be the best way to ensure confirmation that he is COVID-19
      free. The Biden campaign has said on record that Biden and his team are tested
      regularly for the virus.  \n\n#### [When do we consider someone with COVID-19
      to have recovered?](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/when-do-we-consider-someone-with-covid-19-to-have-recovered/)\n\nThis
      is a question that will impact the final weeks of the presidential campaign.
      A review of COVID-19 recovery guidelines being used around the world show most
      doctors agree on the following criteria: 1) Clinical: The patient no longer
      has symptoms, and 2) Laboratory: The patient has negative test results (testing
      through swabs taken from the nose and throat) showing the virus is no longer
      present in the upper respiratory system. Both of these criteria should be considered
      in combination to determine recovery. Negative test results are important because
      people can still spread the virus even if they have no symptoms or their symptoms
      have stopped. It remains to be seen how these types of criteria will be implemented
      amid campaign efforts. \n\n#### [Can someone be infected with COVID-19 more
      than once?](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/can-someone-be-infected-with-covid-19-more-than-once/)\n\nMedia
      [report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/barrett-coronavirus-court-trump/2020/10/02/ecf7c7ce-04cf-11eb-8879-7663b816bfa5_story.html)
      that Supreme Court Justice nominee Amy Coney Barrett tested positive for COVID-19
      earlier in 2020 but then recovered. Barrett has met with senators and the president
      in recent days to discuss her nomination. Can Barrett be reinfected? Our scientists
      say that regardless of the anecdotal evidence, experts still do not know for
      sure if people can become infected with COVID-19 a second time, but it appears
      to be possible. More evidence is needed to determine whether or not reinfection
      can occur in patients, how common it is, and what kind of immunity to the virus
      people might obtain once they have been infected.\n\n#### [Are you as likely
      to die from a common cold as COVID-19?](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/are-you-as-likely-to-die-from-a-common-cold-as-covid-19/)\n\nThe
      president is reported to have mild cold-like symptoms at the time of writing
      this roundup. While symptoms of the common cold can be similar to COVID-19,
      there are some clear differences in the potential severity of the two diseases.
      Namely, COVID-19 is far more lethal than the virus that causes the common cold,
      even though the vast majority of COVID-19 patients only experience mild or no
      symptoms. The president’s COVID-19 diagnosis does remain mild, according to
      White House reports. \n\n#### [What would successful contact tracing look like
      following the President of the United States’ COVID-19 infection?](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/what-would-successful-contact-tracing-look-like-following-the-president-of-the-united-states-covid-19-infection/)\n\nContact
      tracing is one of the most effective ways to control the spread of COVID-19.
      It’s a process that involves tracking down the contacts of any person that tests
      positive for the disease, so that those contacts can themselves get tested and/or
      isolate themselves to stop further spread. Many news reports are currently outlining
      the President’s many points of contact with individuals at rallies, events and
      interactions with supporters and donors. This entry outlines what will be involved
      in chasing down those contacts to ensure further spread can stop before it starts.
      \n\n#### [What does the science say about COVID-19 on surfaces?](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/what-does-the-science-say-about-covid-19-on-surfaces/)\n\nDays
      before his diagnosis, President Trump was seen throwing hats into a crowd at
      a campaign event. Video footage of him doing that is now being reported by multiple
      major media outlets in light of his positive test result. What do we know so
      far about COVID-19 on surfaces, including hats? The virus that causes COVID-19
      primarily spreads through close, person-to-person contact, not through surface
      contamination. However, if a person touches a contaminated surface with traces
      of the virus and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth, they could become
      infected if the surface contains large amounts of the virus. \n\nThis is why
      it is important to clean and disinfect any surfaces that people might come into
      contact with, especially those like doorknobs, cell phones, light switches,
      handles, countertops, sinks, toilets, and more. If possible, people should try
      to avoid touching high-contact surfaces in public. Washing your hands for 20
      seconds, avoiding touching your face, maintaining six feet (two meters) of distance
      and wearing a mask are key steps in combatting the spread of the virus.\n\n####
      [What is the difference between exposure and infection to a virus?](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/what-is-the-difference-between-exposure-and-infection-to-a-virus/)\n\nThe
      president and his aides shared rooms and outdoor spaces with many people in
      the days leading up to the announcement of his COVID-19 infection. There are
      key differences between being exposed to the virus, and being infected with
      it. In this entry, we outline where exposure stops, and infection begins. In
      short, when it comes to infectious diseases, “exposure” means coming into contact
      with a virus or bacteria. Infection happens when someone is exposed and actually
      becomes sick from the exposure. \n\n#### [What short and long-term effects does
      COVID-19 have on other body parts, including lungs, brain, heart and kidneys?](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/what-short-and-long-term-effects-does-covid-19-have-on-other-body-parts-including-lungs-brain-heart-and-kidneys/)\n\nSome
      health experts are concerned that the president’s age and his weight put him
      in a category of people that are most likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19.
      This is because the disease can attack not just a person’s respiratory system
      but also their heart, brain and other organs. This entry outlines some of the
      impacts, short-term and long, that COVID-19 patients experience. In more severe
      cases of the disease, symptoms can impact several organs. These include pulmonary
      embolisms (lungs), strokes (brain), and kidney damage due to a lack of oxygen
      or blood clots.  Often the disease’s symptoms are mild and resolve within a
      couple of weeks, but sometimes they can be more severe. \n\n[What do we know
      about monoclonal antibodies as part of a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19?](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/what-do-we-know-about-monoclonal-antibodies-as-part-of-a-treatment-or-vaccine-for-covid-19/)\n\nWhile
      he was in the hospital, President Trump received an experimental monoclonal
      antibody cocktail from Regeneron as part of his COVID-19 treatment. What *is*
      a monoclonal antibody? Our scientists write that monoclonal antibodies (which
      means ‘one type of antibody’) are antibodies created in a lab that can act as
      a replacement for the antibodies the body normally creates. The difference between
      these lab-made antibodies and those created by the immune system is that the
      monoclonal types are uniquely designed to target a specific antigen, in this
      case the virus that causes COVID-19, so it can send it messages, try to destroy
      it, and even make it easier for the immune system to find the antigen and attack
      it."

    body: "Over the past few years, Meedan has grown significantly, expanding to three
      major programs — [Check Global](https://meedan.com/projects/check-global/),
      the [WhatsApp 3PFC project](https://meedan.com/check) and the [Digital Health
      Lab](https://health.meedan.com/) — alongside our existing initiatives such as
      the [Credibility Coalition](https://credibilitycoalition.org/), [Pop Up Newsroom](https://popup.news/),
      the [Content Moderation Project](https://meedan.com/projects) and our ongoing
      trainings. With this growth comes a need for more operational infrastructural
      support. We're thrilled to welcome Gisela Zuniga to the team as our new executive
      associate, supporting our operational and administrative work throughout the
      organization. She brings her skills as a communicator to the team as well, having
      already helped us run two events and revamping our communications strategy.
      \n\nHere's a short Q&A where we spend some time getting to know Gisela and welcoming
      her to the team!\n\n### 1. What has been your experience before you joined Meedan?\n\nI
      studied filmmaking and cultural studies for undergrad in New York; during this
      time, I completed internships about archiving activist artwork, museum programming,
      and media nonprofit development. After graduating, I joined the independent
      media outlet Neta in my hometown of McAllen, Texas, focused on sharing grassroots
      narratives about the U.S.-Mexico border. I first joined as a video journalist,
      and transitioned to creative strategy, taking on additional freelance work in
      documentary film and mixed reality projects in both Texas and New York. I'm
      a member of [Brown Girls Doc Mafia](https://www.browngirlsdocmafia.com/), a
      global women of color filmmakers group, and do art residencies occasionally.\n\n###
      2. Tell us about a journalism project that you worked on that was exciting and
      insightful.\n\nWhile at Neta, I produced a video about low-income residents
      of Texas border towns organizing to install public lighting in colonias. Colonias,
      or unincorporated settlements of Mexican immigrants and Mexican-Americans, often
      don't have access to sanitation or other city services like the streetlights
      many of us take for granted. We collaborated with local civic rights organization
      [ARISE](http://www.arisesotex.org/), led by the headstrong women of these colonias,
      to develop the Spanish-language script and create a digital landing page for
      this video guide. We got to present this collaborative project in city hall
      to local legislators, and since then many more colonias have been able to get
      public lighting installed!\n\n![Alumbrado Publico](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3cRpMhh9QHDPvjmIT8ldEl/092e0e5e47d919992fa7e2a689bc39dc/Alumbrado_Publico_Screenshot.png)\n<p
      class=\"caption\">November 6, 2018. A 6-year-old girl plays in the streets as
      the sun sets, before her neighborhood goes completely dark. This colonia in
      Alamo, Texas awaits installation of public lights scheduled for January 2019.</p>\n\n###
      3. What is the local news media ecosystem like in the US? What are the strengths
      and what gaps do you see?\n\nBased on my experience, the U.S. local news media
      ecosystem is fundamental to how we understand our lives as community members
      in our town/state/region in a way distinct from national coverage. However,
      local news has been set up to fail by investment capital, corporate influence,
      and the scarcity of sustainable funding models, creating massive gaps for meaningful
      growth. Its strength lies in the resistance of its journalists to imagine a
      better industry and the incredible organizing to bring it to life. Groups like
      [Study Hall](https://studyhall.xyz/) create national dialogues for workers across
      individual contexts to share resources, and [Press On Media](https://www.presson.media/)
      and [Migrant Roots Media](https://www.migrantrootsmedia.org/) has done incredible
      work organizing U.S. Southern BIPOC-led local outlets to connect and build a
      better industry together.\n\n### 4. What brought you to Meedan?\n\nI have become
      increasingly curious about the tech world and its intersection with media over
      the years. While my introduction to this field has been through creative technology
      applications, I've been voraciously learning as much as I can about emerging
      tools to imagine and implement a more just world. Given Meedan's work to support
      fact-checkers worldwide via open-source tool Check, to cultivate the sustainability
      of independent media organizations via the Check Global program, and to explore
      cutting-edge research in AI technology, joining the Meedan team felt like the
      natural next step in my career.\n\n### 5. What skills are you hoping to grow
      at Meedan?\n\nI'm hoping to strengthen my skills in operations management, nonprofit
      development, and to learn more about nuances of the tech industry. My past experience
      working in the arts and media emphasized to me that the way colleagues work
      and communicate with one another is just as vital as the quality of the actual
      product made. Learning how to craft systems that affirm team members, establish
      clear expectations for workflows, and cultivate a culture of care within management
      dynamics not only strengthens my own systems thinking skills, but empowers me
      to envision what a better tech and media world might look like and bring it
      to life.\n\n### 6. Tell us some fun facts about Gisela.\n\n-   Buffy the Vampire
      Slayer is my favorite TV show!\n-   Favorite food is *poc chuc*, a Yucatecan
      Maya dish of grilled pork chops marinated with sour orange and served with pickled
      red onions and avocado.\n-   I think the best ways to get active are salsa dancing,
      roller skating, and taekwondo.\n-   I'm a U.S. Southerner of the Mexican and
      Honduran diaspora, and call the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas home."

    body: "Today’s world has more internet users than people with access to essential
      health services such as primary care, dental care, or surgery. We’ve reached
      700,000 of them across 18 countries, but so much more remains to be done. \n\nMeedan’s
      Digital Health Lab team have created a B2B fact-checking model for health content
      based on syndication. We are testing a hypothesis that a rapid-response process
      where a team of health experts distill scientific evidence based on requests
      made by fact-checkers—requests that other communciators around the world may
      also have— we can meet the needs of audiences searching for health information
      online more efficiently, at larger scales, across regions, and directly where
      searching takes place. \n\nHere are our top-level highlights:\n\n- Our incredible
      team of experts __successfully responds to requests__ for contextualizing the
      scientific research __in as little as 3 hours__\n- Our process has successfully
      reached an audience of __over 700,000 people across Asia, Latin America, Africa,
      Europe and North America__, with localization of both text and accompanying
      visuals (thanks, to [Students Against COVID-19](https://www.studentsagainstcovid-19.com/)
      and [Localization Lab](https://www.localizationlab.org/)) __in 8 languages__
      prioritized by our partners \n- The __public health community__, including health
      literacy practitioners, __is eager and excited to get more involved__ in supporting
      local misinformation response efforts\n\n![meedan covid-19-db-usage-reuters](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/4xgsZVcR02vLjnusBejbyo/189a7297d4d3b38964e5219f5af26ee4/meedan_covid-19-db-usage-reuters.jpg)\n<p
      class=\"caption\">Reporting done by Reuters about herd immunity and COVID-19
      using Meedan Digital Health Lab's COVID-19 Expert Database content.</p>\n\nThrough
      the COVID-19 pandemic, online information searches serve as a supplement to
      reduced availability and accessibility of in-person healthcare. This coincides
      with public health authorities realizing the important role that trusted fact-checking
      organizations with strong community ties play in minimizing the impact of health
      misinformation, especially during a pandemic. At a presentation our team participated
      in about health misinformation hosted by the [National Academies of Science,
      Engineering and Medicine](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/addressing-health-misinformation-through-health-literacy-practices-a-workshop),
      health fact-checking was identified as “the next frontier of health literacy”,
      and, thanks to generous support from the Omidyar Foundation, Google, and the
      Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Meedan’s [Digital Health Lab gets to contribute](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf)
      to the development of this new frontier. \n\nOver the last year and a half Meedan’s
      Digital Health Lab has been developing and deploying a __rapid-response framework
      for supporting fact-checking organizations, journalists and other community
      information leaders__ that are working to address health misinformation online
      across literacy levels and languages. In addition to rapid response, we collaborate
      with behavior scientists, fact-checking organizations to design workshops and
      educational modules to strengthen the efficaciousness of health misinformation
      response efforts. \n\nOur COVID-19 rapid response, the [COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/),
      is focused on: \n- Collecting critical pandemic-related queries directly from
      fact-checking organizations, community newsrooms and other community information
      leaders\n- Triaging COVID-19 content to send to team members with specific public
      health expertise to provide standardized responses\n- Designing visuals to address
      disparities in health literacy\n- Conducting behavior science, machine learning
      and rigorous user research to strengthen this rapid-response process as a replicable
      and scalable framework \n\nThrough __three 48-hour weekly editorial sprints__,
      as well as 3-hour turnarounds for urgent requests, the content produced by the
      Digital Health Lab’s COVID-19 Expert DB & Toolkit has served three major purposes:
      as a reliable source of information relating to rapidly evolving science; providing
      explanations surrounding conflicting evidence and treatment recommendations;
      sharing recommended additional resources for fact-checking organizations and
      journalists to review as they produce the information their communities need.

      health expertise\n\nIn the digital health information ecosystem, building direct
      communication channels involves developing interventions where target audiences
      spend time finding answers to the health questions they have, which today means
      content easily encountered through searches online and through social media.
      Of course, as any one organization, this is really challenging to achieve. \n\nDuring
      this project, we developed a process we call B2B fact-checking: we help the
      fact-checkers fact-check. It was our hope that by building a model based on
      syndication, fact-checkers, journalists and other community information leaders
      can use the content we create directly for them *__as well as__* the content
      we have developed in response to questions shared by other communicators. With
      this model, we can provide the needed health expertise to reduce health misinformation
      more efficiently, at larger scales, and directly where a users’ searching takes
      place. \n\n![meedan covid-19-db-usage-verafiles](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/6vvZJnxxFjGSYprr9KVRM1/ea482f948fb66bbee0fb7760fdfd34f5/meedan_covid-19-db-usage-verafiles.jpg)\n<p

      class=\"caption\">Health communications organization Nigeria Health Watch uses
      Digital Health Lab's COVID-19 Expert Database content to respond to health misinformation
      topics that emerge in countries all over the world, with a localized response
      focus.</p>\n\nOur research with these users has demonstrated how having access
      to experts can increase the subject matter that fact-checkers can cover, and
      therefore the content available online to the fact-checkers’ audiences. The
      examples of where our collaboration with partners in different parts of the
      world have led to first item or first-page search results on Google highlight
      the impact that smaller health organizations can have on influencing the discourse
      online when we can support the work of fact-checkers directly.\n\n### Data sprints
      for the triple bottom line: Substance, Syndication and Speed\n\nOne of the biggest
      challenges of achieving impact at the scale of the internet is moving at the
      speed of the internet. We studied design sprint methodologies from Agile, Google
      Design, and others to create what we call a Data Sprint: a rapid-response framework
      that ensures the triple bottom line of substantive, quality content; syndicated,
      networked impact; and speedy, responsive turnaround times.\n\n__Substance:__
      To date, a small team of scientists with expertise across infectious disease,
      nutritional epidemiology, pandemic preparedness, vaccine adoption and health
      behavior change have created over 110, 500-word science articles over 20 weeks.
      Each article or database ‘entry’ responds  to questions submitted by fact-checkers
      and journalists, with additional information to further distill  each topic’s
      historical and scientific significance for health communicators. \n\nThis impact
      will soon be magnified through a collaboration with Localization Lab, targeting
      8 languages prioritized by our current partners. We are currently working with
      SciLine to expand the global reach of the resources that they have created by
      including them in the short articles we produce for our partners. \n\n__Syndication:__
      Through the syndication model developed for this project, our partners have
      identified an audience of over 700,000 people in more than 18 countries across
      Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe and North America. This audience includes
      podcast listeners, website visitors and newsletter subscribers, and does not
      include the social media followings of our partner organizations. This level
      of impact was made possible through our syndication model for content dissemination,
      enabling a small team of scientists, researchers and communicators to influence
      diverse information spaces.\n\n__Speed:__ The turnaround time for the content
      we produce is 48 hours or less, following the tight editorial cycles of our
      journalism partners. Responses are often created in as few as 5 hours by team
      members on-call to meet urgent partner deadlines. This rapid response directly
      targets midinformation: misunderstandings, misinterpretations and misrepresentations
      based on scant or emerging scientific evidence. Midinformation happens often
      when expert consensus changes over time, and it is distinct from more straightforward
      misinformation. \n\nWe apply principles from Google’s Design Sprint methodology
      into three weekly sprints, including problem mapping and prioritization, solution
      sketching across text and visual responses, and feedback integration from partners.
      Through consistent use of this model, we are able to optimize for the number
      of requests we can address weekly, and can account for responding to a diverse
      set of topics that require reviewing extensive scientific literature across
      a variety of disciplines. \n\n### Key lessons our team has learned over the
      last 6 months\n\nAs a team, we have distilled four key lessons to carry our
      project strategy forward: \n\n1. __It is important to educate health professionals
      about the value of existing approaches being taken by platforms to reduce the
      impact of misinformation.__ Influencing impacts of health misinformation at
      scale requires closer connections between health scientists and communicators
      using tools already optimized for easy online encounters with factual health
      information, such as Google’s ClaimReview and MediaReview annotation frameworks,,
      and partnerships with third-party fact-checking organizations. The health community
      is ready and excited to contribute to projects like this one, and needs guidance
      about where time and effort is best spent.  \n\n2. __Syndication models can
      maximize impact at the scale of the internet.__ Our partnerships with e-newsletters,
      podcasts, communicators with their own syndication models, and collaborations
      with fact-checking organizations and newsrooms have reached over 700,000 people
      in just three months of collaboration. Our goal is to continue supporting communicators
      with their own content development, know that while we can distill the ever-changing
      science successfully, community information leaders know their audiences best,
      and that maximizes the impact of any public health message.  \n\n3. __A focus
      is needed on misinformation related to both vaccines and treatment.__ While
      these represent the majority of the questions shared with us by fact-checkers
      and journalists, the most common questions are not reflected in resources provided
      by intergovernmental or government health institutions. Further, while current
      public health officials estimate that a successful vaccine will be developed
      by the end of 2020 and that vaccination campaigns will start by early 2021,
      a vaccination campaigns’ success is determined by people’s willingness to get
      vaccinated. Patterns in uneven distribution of vaccines globally, and thus uneven
      eradication of certain illnesses, will likely yield inequalities in the elimination
      of COVID-19 in different parts of the world. For this reason, it is essential
      to not only address vaccine misinformation, but also misinformation associated
      with COVID-19 treatments, which may emerge in successful forms earlier than
      the release of a vaccine.\n\n4. __Localization conducted by various stakeholders
      is required to reach & be accessible to community information leaders at a global
      scale.__ Our partners have requested that local health experts, as well as users,
      combine efforts to translate the database content and accompanying visuals into
      local languages. We're grateful to the Localization Lab, and to our public health
      expert translator team, for making this novel approach at localization possible!
      This optimizes for accessibility (including factors related to availability,
      relevance, and literacy), and ensures that fact-checkers and journalists operating
      in diverse languages can all benefit from, and contribute to, improved health
      literacy where their audiences already seek content.  \n\n### What’s next: expanding
      and diversifying our impact\n\nWith these lessons in mind, here’s what’s next
      for our team: \n\n__Expanding scope of response effort:__ Our experts have provided
      contextualization for over 120 topics related to COVID-19, moving at a rate
      of, on average, 10 database articles or “entries” per week. Our collaborators
      are increasingly asking questions about public health topics significant with
      respect to the pandemic, but are distinctly relevant outside of COVID-19. These
      include questions about nutrition, non-communicable diseases, antibiotic resistance
      and reproductive health. Our goal is to provide additional public health expert
      contextualizations for topics outside of COVID-19.  \n\n__Engaging with community-based
      communications networks:__ Our goal is to expand our offerings with a focus
      on rapid responses for community newsrooms, freelance journalists, community
      \ nonprofits and other information leaders within communities. In collaboration
      with our partners, we’re working with the product and development teams at Meedan
      to create more efficient pathways of information-sharing between our experts
      and community information leaders, using dedicated helplines through SMS, WhatsApp,
      Facebook and Twitter. We’re also sharing customizable bot infrastructure so
      community newsrooms can more easily connect their audiences with the health
      information that is directly relevant to their needs. We hope to support these
      groups directly by providing the information that they can tailor to the needs
      of their own communities that they know best. \n\n__Strengthening relationships
      between public health experts, the health literacy community, local newsrooms
      and fact-checking organizations:__ Given the important role community newsrooms
      and fact-checking organizations play in responding to health misinformation
      via social media and online search platforms, integrating more closely with
      the public health community can serve to strengthen health literacy at scales
      larger than ever before. \n\nTo learn more about work, please contact <a href=\"mailto:health@meedan.com\">health@meedan.com</a>.

    body: "Meedan is excited to announce a new collaboration with Facebook Journalism
      Project that will train the next generation of fact-checkers to verify health
      misinformation for their global audiences. \n\nThe initiative, a year-long [global
      health fellowship](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking/global-health-fellowship)
      facilitated by Facebook, will bring on new team members to 10 participating
      fact-checking organizations. Fellows selected by the 10 participating fact-checking
      organizations will take part in virtual training sessions provided by Meedan
      and Facebook. \n\nMeedan will support these fact-checkers with critical training
      on the ethics, standards and core practices for debunking health misinformation
      worldwide. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic shines a light on the critical need to
      support the capacity and skills that are necessary to successfully fact-check
      claims about complex science surrounding treatments, causes, cures, homeopathic
      remedies and vaccines. Health misinformation is running rampant on online platforms
      and there is great need for the next generation of journalists to understand
      how health literacy and health barriers contribute to the spread of disease,
      and how responsible fact-checking and verification efforts can be foundational
      pillars in the equalization of access to high quality health news. \n\nMeedan
      will collaborate on the Facebook training by working with our [in-house experts](https://meedan.com/blog/database-of-expert-sourced-covid-19-information-for-fact-checkers/)
      on developing a curriculum that helps fact-checkers navigate complex health
      debunking tasks in ways that are responsible. We’re so excited to be able to
      contribute to this project and to work with organizations including: \n\n- Tempo,
      Indonesia\n- Vera Files, Phillippines\n- Factly, India\n- The Quint, India\n-
      ColombiaCheck, Colombia\n- La Silla Vacía, Colombia\n- Africa Check, South Africa\n-
      Teyit, Turkey\n- Pagella Politica, Italy\n- Full Fact, UK\n\nThis training will
      be another addition to our suite of COVID-19 resource-building, which already
      includes our public health information tool, [learnaboutcovid19.org](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/).
      It will also be our second training project this year, preceded by the roll
      out of [Google News Initiative-supported curriculum](https://meedan.com/blog/training-the-next-workforce-to-field-dangerous-claims/)
      that is being delivered across nine countries. \n\nMore details to come soon!

      health services such as primary care, dental care, or surgery. We’ve reached
      700,000 of them across 18 countries, but so much more remains to be done. \n\nMeedan’s
      Digital Health Lab team have created a B2B fact-checking model for health content
      based on syndication. We are testing a hypothesis that a rapid-response process
      where a team of health experts distill scientific evidence based on requests
      made by fact-checkers—requests that other communciators around the world may
      also have— we can meet the needs of audiences searching for health information
      online more efficiently, at larger scales, across regions, and directly where
      searching takes place. \n\nHere are our top-level highlights:\n\n- Our incredible
      team of experts __successfully responds to requests__ for contextualizing the
      scientific research __in as little as 3 hours__\n- Our process has successfully
      reached an audience of __over 700,000 people across Asia, Latin America, Africa,

      the COVID-19 pandemic, online information searches serve as a supplement to
      reduced availability and accessibility of in-person healthcare. This coincides
      with public health authorities realizing the important role that trusted fact-checking
      organizations with strong community ties play in minimizing the impact of health
      misinformation, especially during a pandemic. At a presentation our team participated
      in about health misinformation hosted by the [National Academies of Science,
      Engineering and Medicine](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/addressing-health-misinformation-through-health-literacy-practices-a-workshop),
      health fact-checking was identified as “the next frontier of health literacy”,
      and, thanks to generous support from the Omidyar Foundation, Google, and the
      Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Meedan’s [Digital Health Lab gets to contribute](https://health.meedan.com/primer.pdf)
      to the development of this new frontier. \n\nOver the last year and a half Meedan’s
      Digital Health Lab has been developing and deploying a __rapid-response framework
      for supporting fact-checking organizations, journalists and other community
      information leaders__ that are working to address health misinformation online
      across literacy levels and languages. In addition to rapid response, we collaborate
      with behavior scientists, fact-checking organizations to design workshops and
      educational modules to strengthen the efficaciousness of health misinformation
      response efforts. \n\nOur COVID-19 rapid response, the [COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/),
      is focused on: \n- Collecting critical pandemic-related queries directly from
      fact-checking organizations, community newsrooms and other community information
      leaders\n- Triaging COVID-19 content to send to team members with specific public
      health expertise to provide standardized responses\n- Designing visuals to address
      disparities in health literacy\n- Conducting behavior science, machine learning
      and rigorous user research to strengthen this rapid-response process as a replicable
      and scalable framework \n\nThrough __three 48-hour weekly editorial sprints__,
      as well as 3-hour turnarounds for urgent requests, the content produced by the
      Digital Health Lab’s COVID-19 Expert DB & Toolkit has served three major purposes:
      as a reliable source of information relating to rapidly evolving science; providing
      explanations surrounding conflicting evidence and treatment recommendations;
      sharing recommended additional resources for fact-checking organizations and

      health expertise\n\nIn the digital health information ecosystem, building direct
      communication channels involves developing interventions where target audiences
      spend time finding answers to the health questions they have, which today means
      content easily encountered through searches online and through social media.
      Of course, as any one organization, this is really challenging to achieve. \n\nDuring
      this project, we developed a process we call B2B fact-checking: we help the
      fact-checkers fact-check. It was our hope that by building a model based on
      syndication, fact-checkers, journalists and other community information leaders
      can use the content we create directly for them *__as well as__* the content
      we have developed in response to questions shared by other communicators. With
      this model, we can provide the needed health expertise to reduce health misinformation
      more efficiently, at larger scales, and directly where a users’ searching takes
      place. \n\n![meedan covid-19-db-usage-verafiles](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/6vvZJnxxFjGSYprr9KVRM1/ea482f948fb66bbee0fb7760fdfd34f5/meedan_covid-19-db-usage-verafiles.jpg)\n<p

      Digital Health Lab's COVID-19 Expert Database content to respond to health misinformation
      topics that emerge in countries all over the world, with a localized response
      focus.</p>\n\nOur research with these users has demonstrated how having access
      to experts can increase the subject matter that fact-checkers can cover, and
      therefore the content available online to the fact-checkers’ audiences. The
      examples of where our collaboration with partners in different parts of the
      world have led to first item or first-page search results on Google highlight
      the impact that smaller health organizations can have on influencing the discourse
      online when we can support the work of fact-checkers directly.\n\n### Data sprints
      for the triple bottom line: Substance, Syndication and Speed\n\nOne of the biggest
      challenges of achieving impact at the scale of the internet is moving at the
      speed of the internet. We studied design sprint methodologies from Agile, Google
      Design, and others to create what we call a Data Sprint: a rapid-response framework
      that ensures the triple bottom line of substantive, quality content; syndicated,
      networked impact; and speedy, responsive turnaround times.\n\n__Substance:__
      To date, a small team of scientists with expertise across infectious disease,
      nutritional epidemiology, pandemic preparedness, vaccine adoption and health
      behavior change have created over 110, 500-word science articles over 20 weeks.
      Each article or database ‘entry’ responds  to questions submitted by fact-checkers
      and journalists, with additional information to further distill  each topic’s
      historical and scientific significance for health communicators. \n\nThis impact
      will soon be magnified through a collaboration with Localization Lab, targeting
      8 languages prioritized by our current partners. We are currently working with
      SciLine to expand the global reach of the resources that they have created by
      including them in the short articles we produce for our partners. \n\n__Syndication:__
      Through the syndication model developed for this project, our partners have
      identified an audience of over 700,000 people in more than 18 countries across
      Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe and North America. This audience includes
      podcast listeners, website visitors and newsletter subscribers, and does not
      include the social media followings of our partner organizations. This level
      of impact was made possible through our syndication model for content dissemination,
      enabling a small team of scientists, researchers and communicators to influence
      diverse information spaces.\n\n__Speed:__ The turnaround time for the content
      we produce is 48 hours or less, following the tight editorial cycles of our
      journalism partners. Responses are often created in as few as 5 hours by team
      members on-call to meet urgent partner deadlines. This rapid response directly
      targets midinformation: misunderstandings, misinterpretations and misrepresentations
      based on scant or emerging scientific evidence. Midinformation happens often
      when expert consensus changes over time, and it is distinct from more straightforward
      misinformation. \n\nWe apply principles from Google’s Design Sprint methodology
      into three weekly sprints, including problem mapping and prioritization, solution
      sketching across text and visual responses, and feedback integration from partners.
      Through consistent use of this model, we are able to optimize for the number
      of requests we can address weekly, and can account for responding to a diverse
      set of topics that require reviewing extensive scientific literature across
      a variety of disciplines. \n\n### Key lessons our team has learned over the
      last 6 months\n\nAs a team, we have distilled four key lessons to carry our
      project strategy forward: \n\n1. __It is important to educate health professionals
      about the value of existing approaches being taken by platforms to reduce the
      impact of misinformation.__ Influencing impacts of health misinformation at
      scale requires closer connections between health scientists and communicators
      using tools already optimized for easy online encounters with factual health
      information, such as Google’s ClaimReview and MediaReview annotation frameworks,,
      and partnerships with third-party fact-checking organizations. The health community
      is ready and excited to contribute to projects like this one, and needs guidance
      about where time and effort is best spent.  \n\n2. __Syndication models can
      maximize impact at the scale of the internet.__ Our partnerships with e-newsletters,
      podcasts, communicators with their own syndication models, and collaborations
      with fact-checking organizations and newsrooms have reached over 700,000 people
      in just three months of collaboration. Our goal is to continue supporting communicators
      with their own content development, know that while we can distill the ever-changing
      science successfully, community information leaders know their audiences best,
      and that maximizes the impact of any public health message.  \n\n3. __A focus
      is needed on misinformation related to both vaccines and treatment.__ While
      these represent the majority of the questions shared with us by fact-checkers
      and journalists, the most common questions are not reflected in resources provided
      by intergovernmental or government health institutions. Further, while current
      public health officials estimate that a successful vaccine will be developed
      by the end of 2020 and that vaccination campaigns will start by early 2021,
      a vaccination campaigns’ success is determined by people’s willingness to get
      vaccinated. Patterns in uneven distribution of vaccines globally, and thus uneven
      eradication of certain illnesses, will likely yield inequalities in the elimination
      of COVID-19 in different parts of the world. For this reason, it is essential
      to not only address vaccine misinformation, but also misinformation associated
      with COVID-19 treatments, which may emerge in successful forms earlier than
      the release of a vaccine.\n\n4. __Localization conducted by various stakeholders
      is required to reach & be accessible to community information leaders at a global
      scale.__ Our partners have requested that local health experts, as well as users,
      combine efforts to translate the database content and accompanying visuals into
      local languages. We're grateful to the Localization Lab, and to our public health
      expert translator team, for making this novel approach at localization possible!
      This optimizes for accessibility (including factors related to availability,
      relevance, and literacy), and ensures that fact-checkers and journalists operating
      in diverse languages can all benefit from, and contribute to, improved health
      literacy where their audiences already seek content.  \n\n### What’s next: expanding
      and diversifying our impact\n\nWith these lessons in mind, here’s what’s next
      for our team: \n\n__Expanding scope of response effort:__ Our experts have provided
      contextualization for over 120 topics related to COVID-19, moving at a rate
      of, on average, 10 database articles or “entries” per week. Our collaborators
      are increasingly asking questions about public health topics significant with
      respect to the pandemic, but are distinctly relevant outside of COVID-19. These
      include questions about nutrition, non-communicable diseases, antibiotic resistance
      and reproductive health. Our goal is to provide additional public health expert
      contextualizations for topics outside of COVID-19.  \n\n__Engaging with community-based
      communications networks:__ Our goal is to expand our offerings with a focus
      on rapid responses for community newsrooms, freelance journalists, community
      \ nonprofits and other information leaders within communities. In collaboration
      with our partners, we’re working with the product and development teams at Meedan
      to create more efficient pathways of information-sharing between our experts
      and community information leaders, using dedicated helplines through SMS, WhatsApp,
      Facebook and Twitter. We’re also sharing customizable bot infrastructure so
      community newsrooms can more easily connect their audiences with the health
      information that is directly relevant to their needs. We hope to support these
      groups directly by providing the information that they can tailor to the needs
      of their own communities that they know best. \n\n__Strengthening relationships
      between public health experts, the health literacy community, local newsrooms
      and fact-checking organizations:__ Given the important role community newsrooms
      and fact-checking organizations play in responding to health misinformation
      via social media and online search platforms, integrating more closely with
      the public health community can serve to strengthen health literacy at scales
      larger than ever before. \n\nTo learn more about work, please contact <a href=\"mailto:health@meedan.com\">health@meedan.com</a>.

    body: "The COVID-19 pandemic sent rumour mills into a frenzy. The World Health
      Organization described it as a massive infodemic, capable of drowning out reliable
      health guidance in an over-abundance of opinion. From Argentina to South Africa
      we came across new home made remedies about steam and salt water, and long-debunked
      allegations about vaccinations. \n\nBut as fact-checkers know all too well,
      health misinformation is not a peculiarity of the 2020s. From rumours in Northern
      Nigeria about polio vaccinations almost two decades ago, to the more recent
      allegations that Zika and Ebola were made by humans, there is a long history
      of health misinformation - in times of crises, but also in the everyday. We
      all carry a myth passed down to us by a friend or family member in the name
      of tradition, beauty, or propriety.\n\nThis year at Global Fact, we (Olivia
      Vicol, Full Fact; Nat Gyenes, Meedan Digital Health Lab; Eric Mugendi, PesaCheck,
      and Dr. Theresa Amobi, University of Lagos) brought our reviews of academic
      evidence in conversation with fact checkers, with a view to expand upon best
      practices for fact-checking Health Misinformation. We took main lessons from
      psychology and health communication, and nuanced them with the insights of over
      30 fact checkers, journalists, and academics in attendance. The goal was simple:
      develop a standard of care for health misinformation.\n\n![Global-Fact-7 brainstorm-on-misinformation](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/1nHZhDB5dfrywS72JmodER/08d3cdce677407f39b763e4ff8196716/Global-Fact-7_brainstorm-on-misinformation.png)\n<p
      class=\"caption\">Here is some of what participants brainstormed together during
      the health misinformation workshop at Global Fact 7.</p>\n\n### Production\n\n__If
      a rumour is already in public debate, fact check it early to prevent it from
      getting traction through repetition.__ Ever since the 1940s psychologists have
      found that repetition contributes to belief. Our default is to trust, and in
      times of crisis in particular we tend to remember the first explanations we
      come across.\n\n__But don’t give more oxygen to myths which would otherwise
      have remained unknown.__ Fact checking is key to the extent that it stops posts
      rated as false from traveling further on social media. But think about whether
      every claim intercepted this way is worth publicising further. Publicising every
      fact check on claims doubting the safety of the flu vaccine, for instance, can
      unintentionally give those claims much more exposure than if they had just been
      rated as false on social media. This exposure matters, because seeing something
      in the public domain can lead audiences to believe that the safety of the vaccine
      is doubted by a lot more people than it reality is. Social Norms Theory tells
      us that what we think is happening in society is a better predictor of our behaviors
      than what is actually happening. Our health decisions and behaviors may be predicated
      more on our perceptions of what dominant social norms are rather than what they
      actually are. \n\n__Talk with public health experts__ where possible to determine
      whether it is necessary to either a) fact check early, to prevent claims from
      getting traction through repetition, or b) practice strategic silence.  And
      remember that public health experts are also a source of trust. In times of
      uncertainty when rumours abound, including trusted public health experts in
      the content and dissemination of a fact check, can help good information stand
      out from the noise. \n\n__Publish the sources of your information, and the last
      time they were updated, to account for rapidly changing information.__ As global
      health scientist and vaccine uptake specialist Nour Sharara phrased it, “science
      is the truth of today”. This is an especially important concept in constantly
      changing health emergencies where treatments and public health guidelines shift
      based on the latest evidence. As much as you can communicate the fact that if
      something changes in a health context, it is actually a good thing, because
      it means that the public health community has stronger evidence to point towards
      a more informed health policy decision.  \n\n### Headlines\n\n__Phrase your
      headlines as answers, not questions.__ In a time of incidental media consumption,
      headlines are often the only thing the public see. Simply phrasing a headline
      as a question risks having readers remember the inaccurate claim, instead of
      the debunk. This doesn’t just apply to health misinformation. It also applied
      to fact-checking more generally, and is of particular importance when the consequence
      of a fact-check might be a change or modification in a health behavior.   \n\n###
      Content\n\n__Don’t stop at saying what’s wrong.__ Tell the public what is right
      and why. The need to have an explanation for what happens and feel in control
      in our environment is part of human nature. Some of us find these explanations
      in science, religion, or in personal experience - but there is always a why.
      Simply telling the public that something they know is wrong, without updating
      their model of events, can make it easy to fall back on past knowledge. Fill
      that gap. Clearly state what is wrong, but also tell your audience what is right
      and why. For health misinformation, finding resources that can assist with contextualizing
      the topic that you might be fact-checking within the larger body of health research
      can make this process easier. Participants in this workshop emphasized the importance
      of building strong collaborations and projects directly with reliable health
      researchers for this to be as effective as possible. \n\n__Keep unnecessary
      details to a minimum.__ No one has unlimited attention - and processing complex
      information is particularly difficult in times of crisis, when readers are likely
      to be experiencing stress. Make sure that the context and imagery you include
      in your fact checks are necessary to your debunk. Remember that moving images
      (like gifs, videos, and sidebar adverts) are particularly distracting. If your
      fact check includes those details, ask yourself what they add to the public’s
      understanding of the story.\n\n### Imagery\n\n__Don’t use graphic imagery that
      may trigger fear or disgust__ of blood and needles. A study which looked at
      vaccine hesitancy around the world found that many people who experience this
      attitude towards vaccines are also disgusted by needles and blood. We haven’t
      come across research that looks specifically at how graphic imagery shapes the
      interpretation of health fact checks. But until we do, it seems wise to not
      make a case for vaccination, using the imagery associated with fear of it.\n\n###
      Tone & Audience Engagement\n\n__Emphasise high safety, not low risk.__ Research
      reviewed by the WHO indicates that different framings of the same fact can lead
      to very different risk perceptions and behaviours. Focusing on the positive
      effects of an intervention, may be more effective than focusing on the absence
      of negative effects. Think of the difference between saying: vaccines save 3
      million lives a year, and saying: only a very small number of people develop
      side effects.\n\n__Don’t ridicule the claim.__ Provide a safe space for individuals
      seeking health information or wanting to ask questions about health myths or
      beliefs. It is essential for audiences to feel comfortable seeking information
      that might correct long-standing beliefs related to their health or that of
      family members - a deeply personal and important issue for us all. It’s essential
      that, as a community of health information responders, we don’t use words like
      “crazy” or “outlandish” to describe the myths that we correct. We need to reduce
      the stigma of health information-seeking.  Further, even a completely inaccurate
      health claim might have been shared with good intentions. It may have profound
      cultural or religious implications. And most importantly, we don’t have any
      evidence that humour is a more effective way of countering health misinformation
      than a neutral, facts-based piece.\n\n\n____\n\nFor more information about research

    updates: "__Foreword__\n\nWritten by Peter Cunliffe-Jones \n\nWhen voters believe
      false information about political events, they often have only one opportunity
      every few years to act on it, and consequences can be hard to judge. When the
      false information concerns health treatments or the conditions that cause a
      disease to spread, the chances to act misguidedly can be unlimited and the consequences
      can be life or death.\nWhen the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) agreed
      last year to review our Code of Principles, we agreed the code should provide
      a floor, not a ceiling, to standards in our field. In March 2020, the new and
      updated code came into practice, agreed by IFCN signatories to subject our work
      to assessment on the basis of a new raft of standards on methodology and use
      of sources.\n\nThat is the floor. The IFCN of course wants our community to
      always find ways to improve, and in no field does this matter more than health
      misinformation – the topic that first fired my own interest in misinformation
      almost two decades ago. Therefore we welcome this initiative to propose a set
      of best practices for how we as fact-checkers can respond to health misinformation
      both effectively, and safely, a standard of care, if you will, for those we
      serve: our readers, viewers or listeners.\n\nThese proposed best practices are
      simply that. They are not part of the IFCN Code but were developed following
      discussions at Global Fact 7, and we hope that fact-checkers everywhere will
      find ways to review, consider and perhaps improve on them – reaching always
      to improve the important work we do."

    body: "A few weeks ago, in a WhatsApp message group with family members, a forwarded
      message showed up on my screen that read: “The COVID-19 plot thickens, please
      do read.” \n \nIn India, where my family is from, it is typical for a day to
      begin with five or more messages in different family or work WhatsApp groups.
      The messages range from friendly updates and innocent gifs to threads pressuring
      you to forward messages to nine people in order to avoid ill-fated planetary
      alignments.\n \nWhat followed the COVID-19 message a few weeks ago was an elaborate
      thread containing false claims about COVID-19 as a lab-made virus, intended
      to boost the sales of Remdesivir and benefit Bill Gates and George Soros. The
      forwarded text falsely claimed that the entire COVID-19 crisis is a well-orchestrated
      effort at the highest levels by Gates, Soros, Obama, and Clinton to develop
      a COVID-19 vaccine, with “the ultimate motivation of making billions of dollars
      in profits at the cost of only losing a mere million human lives.” This particular
      conspiracy theory was disseminated on Facebook in the United States, and quickly
      spread through WhatsApp in India as well.\n \nIn the United States, journalists
      are battling misinformation on open or partially open social platforms like
      Facebook and Twitter. In India, as in other parts of the world, the problem
      may be trickier to catch—and harder to prevent, because misinformation spreads
      predominantly in closed chat groups on WhatsApp, away from the sights of content
      moderators and fact-checkers.  Blatant misinformation campaigns like the one
      I received recently are dangerous under normal circumstances, and downright
      deadly in the midst of a pandemic. Misinformation makes it harder for healthcare
      authorities to effectively communicate critical health information to wider
      audiences.\n \nWhatsApp misinformation in India sows distrust in healthcare
      institutions and encourages disregard for basic public health advice. Often
      disguised as medical advice, doctored videos of a prominent Indian doctor advising
      viewers not to get tested for coronavirus were circulated over 5,000 times on
      Facebook and Twitter. False rumors have led to many Indian doctors and frontline
      healthcare workers being evicted from their homes. This is especially important
      in the Indian context, where unfiltered and inaccurate information spreads rapidly
      on WhatsApp, and can quickly hamper efforts to trace, isolate, and care for
      COVID cases. Healthcare workers attempting to stop the spread of COVID-19 have
      been attacked by mobs across India as recently as April, and misinformation
      has only exacerbated the violence.\n \nIn March 2020, one particular message
      circulating on WhatsApp caught the attention of the Government of India’s Press
      Information Bureau (PIB). The message falsely claimed that the Government was
      spraying “CV vaccine gas inside the country, through airplanes.”\n \nThe official
      Twitter account of PIB (@PIBFactCheck) responded by stating: “Amidst #Coronavirusoutbreak,
      misinformation on CV Vaccine gas spread out through Airplanes is circulating
      on social media. NO such action has been planned out by the Indian Government.
      Get your facts from trusted sources. Do not amplify #fakenews!”\n \nAge-old
      rumors about vaccine safety are now being tailored to COVID-19 audiences to
      promote vaccine hesitancy, which could derail efforts not only for the eventual
      implementation of a COVID-19 vaccine, but also for the continuation of routine
      vaccinations for myriad other diseases.\n \nThe misinformation amid the pandemic
      is not limited to vaccine hesitancy. In some  parts of India, the indigenous
      cow has been elevated to new heights and questionable treatments, such as cow
      urine, have been marketed as an effective remedy against the novel coronavirus.
      Such claims may have gained legitimacy under the current Government, which created
      an open call for research & development proposals that examine dubious pseudo-scientific
      treatments such as “cowpathy” for “medicine and health” in February this year.
      In such circumstances, it becomes even more difficult to distinguish science
      from pseudoscience in a pandemic, especially as misinformation seems to travel
      even faster than COVID-19 in India.\n \nIn Mizoram, approximately 15 individuals
      were arrested for spreading a fictitious and official-sounding directive from
      state officials, asking local citizens from outside Mizoram to return home at
      once. Similar arrests have taken place in Rajasthan, Odisha, and other Indian
      states. Successive state governments have responded to misinformation by conducting
      mass arrests rather than tackling the problem at its root by improving health
      communication in localized languages.\n \nEffective health communication in
      a pandemic requires systematic investments in health infrastructure and adequate
      training for academics and journalists. Fortunately, many organizations are
      meeting this gap and providing resources and responses to tackle such misinformation.
      Organizations such as SciLine, the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN),
      and COVID Explained have developed several resources, unpacking claims about
      COVID-19. While many such projects focus on general misinformation related to
      COVID-19, there is an increased need for addressing vaccine misinformation specifically,
      and to provide the context needed for individuals that speak a variety of different
      languages, with varying health literacy levels.\n  \nThere is a paucity of evidence-based
      information for journalists, fact-checkers and everyday WhatsApp users to effectively
      unpack disingenuous claims, whether it be anti-vaccine propaganda or the marketing
      of natural and herbal remedies as cures for the coronavirus.\n \nIndia has detected
      1.2 million cases and 30,000 deaths of COVID-19, according to the Ministry of
      Health & Family Welfare. Given the difficulties around active surveillance in
      India, experts believe the actual number could be even higher. Even if official
      estimates are to be believed, however, the contagion of misinformation threatens
      to derail existing efforts and present roadblocks to the development of a future
      vaccine.\n \nIt is now more imperative than ever before to prioritize effective
      health communication in order to tackle the scourge of misinformation, especially
      as we double down on efforts to rein in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n \n*Mohit Nair

    body: "The proliferation of misinformation and disinformation online throughout
      the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly yielded a corresponding ‘infodemic.’ Information
      around the novel coronavirus is shifting daily and narratives vary based on
      the contexts in which we live, work and socialize.  \n\nThis creates a near-perfect
      recipe for a confusing, substandard information ecosystem and intentionally
      false information. Mis- and disinformation related to the pandemic is not just
      \ harmful for individuals, but, because of the nature of the virus, low-quality
      information also adversely impacts the collective and directly contributes to
      greater numbers of cases and deaths. \n\nAs both a graduate student pursuing
      an MPH at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and as a young person
      raised in the American South, I’ve had a lens into two contrasting sides of
      the COVID-19 online informational arena. On the one hand, I have access to some
      of the highest-quality and timely information on the pandemic. On the other,
      I have a lens into American skepticism of the CDC and WHO, and clear gaps in
      which  public health authorities  (such as from Harvard Chan, the CDC, and WHO
      themselves), are not effectively reaching the general public, particularly in
      the digital realm. \n\nMisinformation is highly challenging to regulate, often
      because it spreads  informally across a range of social media platforms. Evidence
      shows that traditional public health interventions on social media, which present
      text-heavy facts on platforms, are inadequate for obtaining wide-reach. This
      becomes particularly clear when those interventions are compared to the reach
      of mis- and disinformation. Exacerbating this challenge is the fact that news
      sources are often not staffed with in-house public health experts, and given
      that, there are significant bottlenecks within academia that preclude a free-flowing
      stream of the most up-to-date health information for journalists.\n\nIn order
      to address this set of challenges, student group Students Against COVID-19 (SAC)
      and [Meedan's COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/) are
      partnering to pair the latest expert health information with digestible infographics
      tailored to online spaces and resharing. Through the partnership, SAC will leverage
      the Meedan Digital Health Lab’s team of experts to translate their most recent
      COVID-19 updates and answers to pressing questions into highly accessible visuals
      particularly intended for online audiences globally. Graphics will be posted
      alongside expert answers on the [learnaboutcovid19.org](http://learnaboutcovid19.org/)
      database for easy viewing and sharing. This pairing of content and visuals has
      the potential for broad impact in mitigating health misinformation online and,
      in turn, improved public health outcomes. \n\n![Zoonotic Diseases](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3hzT12rbPNOOF4inKiGxzp/763ba6cb8a26539ddcd96eebb4e9adaa/Screen_Shot_2020-06-26_at_2.56.45_PM.png)!

    body: "Last week I was fortunate to receive corrective surgery on my disabled
      arm, a remnant of an injury from over 9 months ago. When the COVID-19 pandemic
      hit, changing all of our plans, it understandably delayed non-essential medical
      procedures like the one I needed.\n \nJuly 2020 marks [30 years since the passage
      of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/30th_anniversary/index.html).
      Twelve years ago the [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
      (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html)
      came into effect, which was the first United Nations (UN) human rights treaty
      of the 21st century, and also the UN convention with the largest number of signatories
      in history on its opening day.  \n\nAs I recover, I am reflecting on what these
      mean for my friends and colleagues with disabilities, including disabilities
      that are permanent or longer-term than my own. \n\nWe have made progress through
      high-level decisions and cultural shifts. For example, plans for people with
      disabilities are now included in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, the
      Paris Agreement on Global Climate Change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster
      Risk Reduction, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development.
      Yet there is much more to do  – we still have not achieved universal access,
      and people with disabilities are being disproportionately affected by the COVID-19
      pandemic in multiple ways.\n\n- People with disabilities are at a higher risk
      of severe symptoms and death from COVID-19. A [study published in the *Disability
      and Health Journal*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245650/)
      found that there is a higher COVID-19 fatality rate among people with intellectual
      and developmental disabilities (IDD). The researchers also found a higher concentration
      of COVID-19 cases at younger ages for people with IDD. Last month, the American
      Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) shared [devastating statistics](https://www.aclu.org/news/disability-rights/covid-19-deaths-in-nursing-homes-are-not-unavoidable-they-are-the-result-of-deadly-discrimination/)
      on the anniversary of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v.
      L.C., which recognized that unjustified segregation of people with disabilities
      is a form of discrimination: Nearly 50% of COVID-19 deaths have been among people
      living in nursing homes, psychiatric hospitals, and other congregate settings
      for people with disabilities, while this population only makes up less than
      1% of the U.S. population. The ACLU warns us that these excess and inequitable
      deaths are “not unavoidable – they are the result of deadly discrimination.”\n\n-
      People with disabilities are also excluded as much of our world moves online
      during the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting everything from education and employment
      to essential services and social connection. There is [growing worldwide concern](https://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=2322)
      about the digital divide, where many people still lack access to technologies
      like computers and smartphones, not to mention affordable as well as reliable
      internet and even electricity. The most affected tend to be [lower-income](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/07/digital-divide-persists-even-as-lower-income-americans-make-gains-in-tech-adoption/),
      [older generations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/technology/virus-older-generation-digital-divide.html),
      [racial and ethnic minorities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/20/smartphones-help-blacks-hispanics-bridge-some-but-not-all-digital-gaps-with-whites/),
      [sexual and gender minorities](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/GenderDigital/HRBDT_submission.pdf),
      and [people with disabilities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/07/disabled-americans-are-less-likely-to-use-technology/),
      with many intersectionalities. Exacerbating this, people with disabilities can
      face additional barriers, such as:\n\n\n1.   Increased risks of online harassment
      and discrimination\n\n2.   Lack of adaptations for limited abilities to see,
      hear, and understand content\n\n3.  Lack of adaptations for limited physical
      abilities to use devices (ex.    following my injury, I learned to type using
      one hand supplemented with voice recognition software)\n\nIt is more crucial
      than ever to mitigate barriers like these during a pandemic, where online access
      to quality information and essential activities can directly influence health
      outcomes.\n\nHere at Meedan, the Digital Health Lab is working to address “viral
      misinformation that facilitates the spread of a particular health outcome or
      disease,” also called a “misinfodemic,” by increasing access to expert-sourced
      information about COVID-19. \n\nMeedan’s efforts to increase access include
      avoiding jargon to make information readable by the general public, providing
      a glossary with simplified definitions of scientific terms, translating information
      for non-English speakers, and disseminating information across diverse media
      channels. In this process, we cannot forget to include people with disabilities.
      Leaving out people with disabilities means hurting a significant proportion
      of humanity: The World Health Organization (WHO) [estimates that over 1 billion](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health)
      people experience some form of disability. Additionally, the ADA and CRPD require
      making online content, services, and systems accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nEquality
      under the law does not automatically translate to equity in everyday practice.
      We have to do the hard work of building the inclusive world we’d like to see,
      and we need to continuously work on addressing ableism and centering disability
      justice. Meedan’s Digital Health Lab is striving to increase access to COVID-19
      information for all, including people with disabilities, and we invite you to
      join us.\n\nResources:\n\n[ADA Best Practices Chapter 5 Website Accessibility](https://www.ada.gov/pcatoolkit/chap5toolkit.htm)\n[Federal

    body: "Breastfeeding promotes early childhood cognitive development, prevents
      young child infections including pneumonia and diarrhea, and improves mental
      and physical health in mothers. That’s why each year during the first week of
      August, [World Breastfeeding Week](https://worldbreastfeedingweek.org) is celebrated
      to raise awareness and promote breastfeeding as the best source of nutrition
      for most babies. \n\nGeneral breastfeeding guidance from the World Health Organization
      (WHO) and other leading health authorities includes breastfeeding for the first
      six months of life all the way to two years of age and beyond.\n\nUnfortunately,
      misinformation about breastfeeding is widespread. Claims often center around:\n\n-
      Foods breastfeeding mothers should or should not eat (In general, [breastfeeding
      moms](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/diet-and-micronutrients/maternal-diet.html)
      should eat a varied diet and don’t need to include or avoid specific foods except
      for some seafood that may be high in mercury.)\n\n- If exercise changes the
      taste of breastmilk ([Exercise](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      is healthy and has not been shown to change the taste of breastmilk.)\n\n- Whether
      negative emotions affect breastmilk quality (Breastmilk quality [doesn’t change](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      based on mom’s emotions.)\n\n- Whether it is okay for a mother to breastfeed
      if she is ill ([In most cases](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding),
      moms should continue to breastfeed even when they’re ill because breastmilk
      passes on immune defense to the baby, but there are some exceptions so always
      check with your or your baby’s doctor.)\n \nExacerbating the issue, early in
      the coronavirus pandemic incomplete scientific consensus and confusion resulted
      in brand new types of breastfeeding [misinformation](https://www.iol.co.za/lifestyle/family/baby/covid-19-moms-and-breastfeeding-separating-facts-from-fiction-add70b6c-9821-4471-8297-67e69947c5b1).
      Because little was known about the virus, many feared that the virus would spread
      from mothers to their infants through [breastmilk](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      and those concerns were shared widely in online communities. \n\nOffline challenges
      of COVID-19 have also taken hold. Lockdown limits access to pre- and postnatal
      lactation support [services](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
      leaving mothers vulnerable to online or familial misinformation in the absence
      of professional breastfeeding support. Some women have been [advised](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036629/)
      by doctors not to breastfeed or to stop breastfeeding. \n\nIn some cases, babies

      separated from mothers in hospitals, a practice known to make establishing breastfeeding
      [difficult](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html),
      decrease breastfeeding [success](https://trends.hms.harvard.edu/2020/03/31/covid-19-separating-infected-mothers-from-newborns-weighing-the-risks-and-benefits/),
      inhibit [early bonding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27885658/) and attachment,
      and [negatively impact maternal mental health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842365/).
      Finally, some reports have also suggested that formula companies began further
      undermining breastfeeding messages by promoting formula as safer than breastmilk
      during the pandemic.\n \nNow, eight months into the pandemic, we have improved
      understanding and data, so breastfeeding recommendations for mothers infected
      with COVID-19 are clearer. Despite misinformation, while studies of breastmilk
      and breastfeeding are ongoing, current research shows that the risk of an infant
      becoming infected with COVID-19 through breast milk is low. \nThe WHO [suggests](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      that “at this point, it appears that COVID-19 in infants and children represents
      a much lower threat to survival and health than other infections that breastfeeding
      is protective against.” Meanwhile the threat of poor health outcomes as a result
      of not breastfeeding is [particularly true](https://www.bfmed.org/assets/DOCUMENTS/abm-position-breastfeeding.pdf)
      in areas where access to clean water and medical care are limited.\n \nFor those
      on the front lines who are supporting moms and babies everyday, providing encouragement,
      addressing misinformation, and empowering mothers to make well-informed feeding
      decisions, are a huge part of providing high-quality care. While babies are
      not immune from contracting COVID-19, based on the current evidence the WHO
      advises that even with suspected or confirmed maternal COVID-19, breastfeeding
      is recommended for infants and young children. The U.S. Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention further advise mothers to further discuss breastfeeding
      with their healthcare providers.\n \nResources:\n[World Alliance for Breastfeeding.

      [As we've seen](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/using-misinformation-as-a-political-weapon-covid-19-and-bolsonaro-in-brazil/), health misinformation is escalating not only within Western democracies but also at a dangerous scale in emerging economies, where independent media workers and organizations have had to wade through financial, physical, and mental strain. As the Check Global team continued to monitor the ramifications of COVID-19 on emerging economies and independent media organizations, the need to act was undeniable.

      Meedan has engaged in a company-wide effort to address our partners' challenges, whether through building new technologies[ such as the COVID-19 Check Bot](https://meedan.com/blog/covid-19-whatsapp-bot-for-fact-checkers/), providing independent newsrooms and partners with [a database led by expert epidemiologists and public health workers](https://meedan.com/blog/database-of-expert-sourced-covid-19-information-for-fact-checkers/) to facilitate fact-checking and verification initiatives, or contributing to [global research](https://meedan.com/blog/global-misinfodemic-report/) about COVID-19-related misinformation. In the interest of reaching out to new organizations in need, the Check Global team announced on April 8 a call to [support media organizations and media workers in Asia-Pacific, in Africa, in Latin America and in the North Africa Western Asia region through a series of micro-grants.](https://meedan.com/blog/new-microgrants-for-covid-19-media-work-in-emerging-economies/) The microgrants projects ranged amongst fact-checking projects, media literacy campaigns and daily blogging reflecting on applicants' quarantine realities. We were blown away by the popularity of our call, receiving a whooping 298 applications in less than 30 days!

      While overwhelming and heartening, the large pool of applications made the selection process challenging. A few criteria guided us in this process. Originality and the innovative nature of the application were  important factors in the selection. Some applications stood out for their creativity and clarity. Applications were also shortlisted on the basis of their achievability --- projects that proposed activities and outputs that could be realistically achieved during the current health crisis were prioritised. Finally, outreach and potential impact were also important factors. Projects that strengthened the involvement of underserved communities and represented issues of people in areas outside the radar of mainstream media made it to the final selection process. We had limited funding, but there are many applications that are deserving, and we hope to be able to support those projects at a later stage.

      In this round, we awarded 25 projects with funding that ranged between $300 and $2,500, for a total of $52,000. From organisations involved in relief work around COVID-19 to individuals committed to tracking the impact of the pandemic on local communities, - the range of applications was wide, rich and diverse. Given the work they do, some of these grantees face risks of political repression, and we're not able to list all of them here. Here are some of the highlights from our work:


      ### APAC: 7 Fact-checking projects targeting vulnerable groups

      We received close to 40 applications from the Asia Pacific region.

      We selected seven applications for media work have been selected from the APAC region for the COVID-19 microgrants. These represent six countries in the region, with a particular focus on Southeast and South Asia --- Cambodia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Nepal, India and Sri Lanka. The creation of online content that is fact-checked and accurate has been an area around which a few groups have designed their projects. [Open Development Cambodia](https://opendevelopmentcambodia.net/) has designed a project to create an online information hub in order to provide fact-checked information to citizens and civil society organisations. In the Philippines, we are thrilled to support the work of an individual, Carol Dawonlay/[Lalang Hu Mga Laga](https://www.facebook.com/pg/storiesofwomencampaign/posts/) who will produce social media cards and videos to highlight violence against women during the pandemic. [BASAbali](https://basabali.org/) in Indonesia is in the process of designing a digital literacy campaign around COVID-19 with the underserved and minority communities in Bali.

      We're also happy to support [Disability Empowerment Society Nepal](https://www.facebook.com/DisabiltyEmp/); they have designed a project to create an accessible website to provide news and information on COVID-19 to people with disabilities. In India, [Sadbhavana Trust](http://sadbhavanatrust.org.in/) will strengthen the leadership and meaningful participation of young women from underserved communities in addressing the COVID-19 outbreak by creating online content from a feminist perspective. [International Youth Alliance for Peace](https://iyapsl.org/) in Sri Lanka will design a  blogging project to capture stories of frontline workers addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.

      ### Africa: 6 efforts curbing the ramifications of the COVID-19 misinfodemic

      We were thrilled by the 170 applications we received from Africa, which made up the majority of our overall application pool. Due to our limited funds we were only able to support six  applications from Nigeria, Somalia, Kenya, Guinee, Tanzania, Zambia. Here are highlights from four of these.

      [People's Check](http://www.peoplescheck.org/) in Nigeria is launching the 'Verify Nigeria' project to fact-check and verify viral health misinformation and disinformation that has affected people's health and life in Nigeria. People's Check will create different visual elements and participate in training students and citizen journalists on health fact-checking training. [Radio Daljir SOMALIA](https://www.daljir.com/) will support media literacy efforts in Somalia and design audio campaigns and radio reporting to bring health facts to the public, encourage COVID-19 prevention measures & make social distancing possible. Radio Daljir will target communities in Somalia's regions of Puntland and Galmudug States of Somalia with a focus on the situation of the nomads. [Zéro Pauvre Afrique (ZPA, "Zero Poor in Africa")](https://www.facebook.com/zeropauvreenafrique/) will track, deconstruct, disseminate misinfodemics with support of a network of volunteers in order to reduce their impact on the management of the COVID-19 crisis in Guinea.

      Family Welfare Foundation's project will contribute to ensuring engagement of human rights defenders and activists with local artists in documenting, information sharing, reporting and amplifying voices on injustice issues, human rights abuse and repressions associated to COVID-19 interventions in Tanzania.

      We are building on the success of the COVID-19 microgrants to create different media funds in Africa that can support more innovative projects.


      ### Latin America: Sustaining the work of 5 women-led independent media organizations

      We received 47 applications from Latin America in both Spanish and Portuguese. The majority of the 7 selected initiatives are led by women and are covering the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in their regions. [Coletivo Cirandeiras](https://www.instagram.com/cirandeiras/) will produce podcast episodes on the stories of women leaders in underrepresented and marginalized communities in Brazil. We will also be supporting the fact-checking work of an alliance of two independent media outlets in Cuba ([Periodismo de Barrio](https://www.periodismodebarrio.org/) and [elTOQUE](https://eltoque.com/)) to increase regional awareness in matters related to the pandemic. Another fact checking initiative [Eté Checagem](https://www.etechecagem.com/) agency works and specializes in human rights and guidelines relating to the women, youth and LGBTQIA population in Brazil. [Ruda Coletiva](https://rudacolectiva.com) a group of Latin America women photographers, will do a visual investigation of the impact that the pandemic has had in the food chain throughout the region. With the theme "From my window" [Coletivo Mulherias](https://mulherias.blogosfera.uol.com.br/) will coordinate a group of women journalists living in the slums of Brazil portraying their routine during the pandemic. In Ecuador we will hear [Isabel Gonzales and Chicas Poderosas ](https://www.instagram.com/chicaspoderosasec/)develop a new podcast that aims to inform and support the journalist community in Latin America suffering the consequences of COVID-19 in their work. And in El Salvador we will support the work of photographer [Giuzeppe Dezza](http://www.GDezza.net) and his work on documenting the impacts of the pandemic in the country.

      ### NAWA: Supporting 5 investigations and fact-checking initiatives
      As for applications from the North Africa Western Asia region, we were lucky to receive 24 applications, both in English and Arabic.

      We are pleased and excited to support five projects from the region, divided between media literacy campaigns, fact-checking initiatives and in-depth investigations. [Radio Medenine](http://radiomedenine.com/), a community radio project based in southern Tunisia, aims to create a digital health program interviewing health experts and providing pressing health information. Award-winning collaborative blog [Nawaat](http://nawaat.org/portail/) ("the core" in Arabic), also from Tunisia, will be sustaining its trilingual fact-checking efforts through our grant over the next month, while media platform [SyriaUntold](https://syriauntold.com/en/) will publish a series of investigative reports about health disparities in Syria. We were also happy to fund an investigation on the state of African refugees in Tangier and a health fact-checking campaign in Egypt.

      The above COVID-19 microgrants recipients have given Meedan consent to announce their projects publicly, while others have not been named for security reasons.
