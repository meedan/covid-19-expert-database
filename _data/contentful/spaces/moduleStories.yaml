    body: "__The fields of public health and human rights are inextricably linked.__
      Increasingly, access to information is a mediator of access to health. The important
      role that digital rights plays in protecting and promoting the right to health
      was particularly pertinent this year, with panels addressing health data privacy,
      access to medicines, mental health and digital first responders, and gendered
      misinformation online. It is important to critically examine the pathways through
      which any individual or community is able to encounter health information digitally,
      and the barriers, limitations and challenges brought about by limited localization,
      zero-rated mobile data plans, inconsistent or obtrusive content removals and
      moderation decisions, especially through COVID-19, which has limited the ability
      of seeking health care in-person.\n\n— Nat Gyenes, Program Director, Digital
      Health Lab\n\n__We need to keep data about Latin America's activist memory safe.__
      During this pandemic-infused reality I focused my attention on panels that were
      contextualized for Latin America on the subjects of censorship, content moderation
      and trust. I intended to create a mental landscape of shared concerns in the
      region, such as COVID-19 data colonialism practices and the importance of initiatives
      that take into account the country's data governance and independence during
      these times instead of readily sharing models that take national data into international
      service providers such as Amazon. \n\nFrom the learnings and context from the
      community came the [Recordkepers of the Resistance project](https://meedan.com/blog/preserving-latin-american-activist-history-on-social-media/),
      which aims to initially map activist content in Latin America related to feminist
      agendas, gender representation, race, sexual diversity and freedom of expression
      that were removed from the main corporate social media platforms. Collecting
      these data as a form of hypothesis testing is the first step. The future objective
      is to publicize this issue with materials aimed at activists in Spanish and
      Portuguese, uniting these issues in a coalition of organizations, sharing safe
      archiving and memory conservation practices and creating a Code of Ethics for
      archival activism in social networks. \n\n— Isabella Barroso, Program Manager,
      Latin America\n\n\n__Tech solutionism is still with us.__ The temptation to
      answer problems with software is often well-meaning, but the people who will
      be most affected are not always part of the design process. There was a discussion
      about health passports during pandemics. Reducing harm to vulnerable groups
      means any implementation would have to be so narrow in scope and so well-regulated
      that skepticism is warranted. I was encouraged by the sessions that were led
      by mental health researchers, because while they were talking about apps to
      address social issues, they started with recommending existing non–tech standards
      of care and the need to fill gaps in our understanding of mental health. A panel
      on gender-based violence, and a panel on trauma mitigation both addressed myths
      surrounding memory and resilience after experiencing horrible things. Mental
      health experts should be a core part of software design for human rights work.\n\n—
      Karen Reilly, Manager, Technology Partnerships\t\n\n__COVID-19 isn’t a black
      swan—it’s a canary in the coal mine for human rights abuses.__ There was a distinct
      sense from the sessions about the stakes of this moment — at least year’s RightsCon,
      we were very keen to bring health to the conversation around rights, and the
      new context of this pandemic has made it absolutely a top priority. It was encouraging
      to see how people recognized that COVID-19 intersected with key human rights
      issues, such as content moderation and free expression, platform governance
      and responsibility, and the ongoing repression of activists and journalists.
      It made it really clear to me that the global trauma of [COVID-19 isn’t a black
      swan but rather a canary in a coal mine](https://meedan.com/blog/this-pandemic-isnt-a-swan-its-a-canary/),
      revealing the inherent weaknesses, fissures and dangers of our global digital
      society.\n\n— An Xiao Mina, Operations\n"

    body: "Meedan is leading this project that aims to mobilize the Latin American
      activist community around the [risks related](https://globalvoices.org/2019/05/01/envision-a-new-war-the-syrian-archive-corporate-censorship-and-the-struggle-to-preserve-public-history-online/)
      to corporate social media platforms becoming responsible for preserving the
      history and memory of activist movements, while there is still a total lack
      of transparency regarding its content moderation policies and private interests.\n\nThe
      objective of every archive should be to share the memory of movements, to create
      belonging and ties with communities and to save collective history. But, how
      to ensure that there is a story to tell and study in the future when these records
      are on private platforms? The idea here is to ensure that memories of resistance
      are preserved.\n\n### Erasing Latin American resistance history, now in the
      digital context\nThe history of Latin America is marked by the erasure of resistance.
      First with the genocides of indigenous people [that occurred](https://noticias.r7.com/prisma/nosso-mundo/brasil-e-lider-disparado-no-genocidio-de-indios-na-america-latina-24042018)
      across the continent and that decimated civilizations that tried to resist European
      invaders over the centuries and later through [military dictatorships](https://noticias.uol.com.br/colunas/leonardo-sakamoto/2020/07/15/militares-se-chocam-com-genocidio-apos-o-genocidio-indigena-na-ditadura.htm),
      corrupt governaments, and [racist eugenic](https://www.almapreta.com/editorias/realidade/existe-genocidio-negro-no-brasil)
      policies.\n\nThis process extends to the present day, in 2019 Latin America
      was considered the most dangerous region in the world for human rights activists,
      according to [Amnesty International](https://anistia.org.br/noticias/da-retorica-pratica-2019-foi-um-ano-marcado-por-retrocessos-para-os-direitos-humanos-brasil-mostra-relatorio/),
      with 210 people killed. This count includes LGBTQI +, women's rights and anti-corruption
      advocates. It is the region that has [killed most journalists](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/01/1055601)
      this past year, twenty-two members of the press have been murdered. 2020 marks
      a period in which the region has become the epicenter of the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://g1.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2020/06/24/america-latina-supera-100-mil-mortes-por-covid-19.ghtml),
      with worsening economic instability and [conservative governments](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/08/crise-multinivel-na-america-latina-esta-mais-complexa.shtml)
      that flirt with militarism in the region.\n\nThe pandemic caused this activism
      that took the streets with the [Feminist Spring](https://brasil.elpais.com/internacional/2020-03-09/milhares-de-mulheres-mostram-sua-forca-nas-ruas-da-america-latina.html)
      to turn to social networks and technologies, as is the case of [indigenous leaders
      ](https://revistamarieclaire.globo.com/Mulheres-do-Mundo/noticia/2020/08/unindo-tradicao-e-tecnologia-mulheres-indigenas-lideram-enfrentamento-pandemia.html)who
      organize themselves in WhatsApp groups and use social media channels to hold
      events live from inside their homes. It is essential given this scenario to
      understand that social media platforms have a central role as disseminators
      of this content and as a digital agora. However, they are corporate companies
      and not elected governments and representative of democratic values responsible
      for guarding and ensuring that these memories and narratives are preserved and
      have space to be communicated.\n\nActivism content on social media remains at
      risk of exclusion, hacking or censorship this has happened before, when YouTube's
      new algorithmic policies, launched in 2017, led to the disappearance overnight
      of the documentation of human rights abuses in Syria . According to the 2019
      report by the [EFF (Eletronic Frontier Foundation), \"Stuck in the network:
      the impact of 'extremist' speech regulations on human rights content\"](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/caught-net-impact-extremist-speech-regulations-human-rights-content),
      in which YouTube used automatic signage with machine learning to withdraw thousands
      of Syrian YouTube channels that were publishing videos documenting human rights
      violations.\n\nThere is a constant tension between social media platforms with
      their non-transparent content moderation policies and the presence of content
      from communities considered diverse. We see content primarily related to freedom
      of expression and diversity being removed from these spaces, as identified by
      [research conducted by Salty](https://saltyworld.net/algorithmicbiasreport-2/)
      (an American newsletter) with his readers on the bias of algorithms, policing
      content by social media platforms when focused on race, queer and gender content.
      This research is one example that shows how marginalized communities are disproportionately
      affected by I[nstagram's content policies](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/08/instagram-shadow-bans-marginalised-communities-queer-plus-sized-bodies-sexually-suggestive).\n\nThis
      project is being initiated based on the absence of data for research regarding
      the content of Latin American activists being removed from social media platforms.
      There are initiatives by institutions and civil organizations in the region
      that are [articulating conversations and recommendations](https://tiinside.com.br/04/08/2020/organizacoes-brasileiras-e-latino-americanas-lancam-documento-sobre-regulacao-de-grandes-plataformas-online/)
      on the lack of transparency regarding the applied policies and the use of content
      moderation algorithms.\n\n### Collaborating and dialoguing with the community\nWe
      had the opportunity to discuss this issue and project with the Internet [Freedom
      Festival Glitter Meetup community](https://www.internetfreedomfestival.org/wiki/index.php/July_16_2020_GM),
      and at the international human rights event [RightsCon 2020 - Recordkeepers
      of the Resistance](https://rightscon.course.tc/2020/events/recordkeepers-of-the-resistance-do-you-trust-the-dark-force-to-save-your-activist-history-8bqf3iLHDWWpwxSnGzxBRB/).\n\n###
      The project phases\n\n#### 1. Validation of the hypothesis\nResearch with activist
      communities through a questionnaire and data collection to validate the hypothesis:
      \"Activists are having their content removed from social networking platforms
      in Latin America\".\n\n#### 2. Network working group\nCreate a working group
      with representatives of civil human rights organizations to analyze the data
      and organize the information;\n  \n#### 3. Content creation activities with
      and for the activist community\nCreate a listening process with the communities,
      map the needs and gather case studies, collaborate in contextualized toolkits
      and workshops for the preservation of activist digital content;\n\n#### 4. Consortium
      and code of ethics\nCreate a code of ethics for archiving social media content
      and mediation with social media platforms.\n\n__Want to collaborate with us?__\nRespond
      and share this [survey](https://forms.gle/mr4uGQU59ATuq9fAA) with Latin American
      activists\n\n[<LINK TO SURVEY IN ESPANISH AND PORTUGUESE>](https://forms.gle/mr4uGQU59ATuq9fAA
      \"Link to the survey \")\n\n#### Objective of this study\nThe purpose of this
      study is to collect and analyze information about activists who use social networks
      in Latin America to carry out their activism and preserve their history and
      memory. The survey will take approximately 8 minutes to complete. The results
      of this study will improve our understanding of activists and their practices
      to preserve the memory of their resistance movements in Latin America and how
      they are affected by content moderation policies on social media platforms.\n\n####
      Study Methodology and Survey\nYou will receive a series of 15 questions and
      complete an anonymous online survey. The questions are about your experiences
      using social media and how they affected your activism and / or the organization
      of memory in your community, your movement and activism practice. Answer the
      questions in the best possible way and feel free to ignore all the questions
      that you are not comfortable answering.\n\n#### Questions about gender identity,
      sexual orientation, race and ethnicity\nIt is necessary to understand whether
      the policies implemented by the platforms affect differently the people who
      express their identity and resistance practices in these channels. All answers
      are optional, but it is necessary to emphasize the importance of these markers
      in the analysis.\n\n#### Privacy and Trust\nWe understand that the information
      you will share might be of a sensitive and private nature, that is why this
      is an anonymous survey, all data is anonymous and will be analysed as such.
      If you have security concerns when filling out this survey we encorage you to
      open the survey link in an anonymous tab on your browser as well as the use
      of a VPN service.\n\n#### Risks / Benefits\nPlease, ignore any questions you
      want or end the survey at any time. It's possible that through contributing
      to this research you may have the opportunity to reflect on your experiences
      with using social media in recent months and the need for independent content
      preservation practices. \n\n#### Community\nThe materials and reports created
      from this survey will be shared with the community. If you know an organization
      that is doing similar work, share it and let's connect!\n"

    body: |-
      Early in the days of COVID-19, as it was just starting to leave the confines of East Asia, a number of people I know started calling the then-emergent pandemic a "black swan event." This is a metaphor for something very rare and difficult to predict. It would be a fitting one if COVID-19 was like the Spanish Flu---a once in a century event that wreaks havoc and then is quickly forgotten. It's become popular in finance circles thanks to the work of options trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb. As summarized in Wikipedia, [Black swan theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) has three key charateristics:

      1.  The disproportionate role of high-profile, hard-to-predict, and rare events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations in history, science, finance, and technology.

      2.  The non-computability of the probability of the consequential rare events using scientific methods (owing to the very nature of small probabilities).

      3.  The psychological biases that blind people, both individually and collectively, to uncertainty and to a rare event's massive role in historical affairs.

      A striking image --- just because we've never seen a black swan doesn't mean it doesn't exist ---, it's wholly inadequate for understanding COVID-19. [An article in Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90475793/why-the-coronavirus-crisis-is-a-gray-rhino-and-not-a-black-swan) helped me understand and dispense with that metaphor pretty quickly:

      > But true linguists say that the proper metaphor for the crisis is a "gray rhino," which refers to highly probable but neglected threats that have an enormous impact. It was coined by Michele Wucker, a policy analyst who came up with the term after the 2012 Greek financial crisis.

      Indeed, nearly two years ago,[  Atlantic writer Ed Yong pointed out that the US](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/when-the-next-plague-hits/561734/)---and, as we've learned, the world---is simply not ready for a pandemic:

      > Perhaps most important, the U.S. is prone to the same forgetfulness and shortsightedness that befall all nations, rich and poor---and the myopia has worsened considerably in recent years. Public-health programs are low on money; hospitals are stretched perilously thin; crucial funding is being slashed. And while we tend to think of science when we think of pandemic response, the worse the situation, the more the defense depends on political leadership.

      > When Ebola flared in 2014, the science-minded President Barack Obama calmly and quickly took the reins. The White House is now home to a president who is neither calm nor science-minded. We should not underestimate what that may mean if risk becomes reality.

      ![This pandemic isn’t a swan—it’s a canary](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/6hTpSXjNGPRuVKV4KnuGZs/08f9b2b3458c7197cff220daed69a6f6/EF3E3911-3032-4865-AC7A-D096912D60ED.JPG)
      <p class="caption">Image CC BY-NC-ND Rose Davies on Flickr</p>

      Many have seen this rhino coming. It was standing there all along. As early as 2017, [the Pentagon was aware of the risks](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/05/827692672/report-pentagon-aware-of-possible-coronavirus-threat-for-years), and the film [Contagion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contagion_(2011_film)), shot in 2011 and depicting a global pandemic and its effects on common people and institutions alike, feels eerily prescient but is only predictive because it's based on solid science about pandemic risk.

      But as I learn more about the pandemic and the conditions that enabled it to spread so quickly---poor public health systems, science denialism, and the steady encroachment of humans onto animal environments, among other factors---I think another metaphor is more fitting: the canary in the coal mine.

      Consider the words of health writer Sonia Shah [in a recent cover story for The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/pandemic-definition-covid/):

      > It's time for a new story, one that more accurately captures the reality of how contagions unfold and why. In this story, pandemics would be cast as both a biological reality and a social phenomenon shaped by human agency. And the coronavirus, if cast as any kind of monster at all, would be a Frankenstein's monster: a creature of our own making. We, after all, created the world in which SARS-Cov-2 evolved, one in which our industry has swallowed up so much of the planet that microbes from wild animals easily slip into livestock and humans. We created the society of overcrowded prisons and nursing homes staffed by underpaid employees who must work in multiple facilities to make ends meet; in which employers force their workers to labor on meatpacking lines even if they're sick; in which asylum seekers are crammed into detention centers; and in which people living in hard-hit cities like Detroit lack access to clean water with which to wash their hands.

      > A narrative that elevates these realities would compel us to consider a much wider range of policy responses to counter the threat of pandemics. Instead of blaming outsiders and waiting for magic bullet cures, we could work to enhance our resilience and reduce the probability of pathogens reaching us in the first place. Instead of reflexively demanding that killing chemicals be slathered across the landscape to destroy mosquitoes infected by the West Nile virus and ticks infected with Lyme disease bacteria, we could restore the lost biodiversity that once prevented their spread. We could protect the forests where bats roost, so that Ebola, SARS, and other viruses stay in them and don't find their way into human populations.

      The phrase "canary in a coal mine" comes from an English-language metaphor based on the fact that canaries--which are more susceptible to methane than human beings--were brought to mines as a precaution. If the canary died, it meant methane was leaking, and that people needed to evacuate immediately. The canary was a warning that something was wrong with the mine, and that greater danger lay ahead.

      Instead of a black swan or a gray rhino, we might call COVID-19 a yellow canary event --- an event that warns of even greater dangers to come.  Like the real-world canary in the coal mine, the death of something we like is a sign that something is fundamentally wrong with the metaphorical mine we live in.

      We might consider yellow canary event as having some of the following characteristics:

      -   A signal that is itself disturbing but to an expert is doubly so because of the conditions it reveals;

      -   Hurts vulnerable populations and systems first, in a highly visible way;

      -   Exposes a structural weakness that will cause tremendous harm to everyone if allowed to continue

      This is COVID-19: it is a biological entity with sociological roots and geopolitical effects. And as it harms black, indigenous and people of color and global south communities more than others, as it strikes the elderly and the infirm and the underpaid and migrants, and as the response becomes politicized, we are reaping the consequences of many significant societal problems. It's not a coincidence that Black Lives Matter and other social movements are rising now --- the pandemic is the yellow canary for the fissures we've allowed to form in society that have generally been ignored.

      The misinfodemics around the pandemic are deeply intertwined with these challenges. [In a 2018 article in The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/), colleague Nat Gyenes and I looked at some of the underlying conditions that have created a field of risk: search engine algorithms and social media feeds based on attention, long-running distrust in science, the complexity with which science is communicated. Much of public health, we wrote, "remains focused on providing communications guidelines and engaging in traditional broadcast-diffusion strategies, but not search-engine optimization, viral marketing campaigns, and accessing populations through social-diffusion approaches."

      COVID-19 is a yellow canary event for the kind of environmental destruction we should expect globally, the racial and global inequalities we've allowed and encouraged to fester, the information ecosystems we've funded through advertising, and a long-running denialism of both the social and biological sciences. When miners see a dead canary, they know it's time to evacuate. But in the context of a global pandemic, there's nowhere else to go. We have to face it, understand the underlying causes, and do our best to change them.

    body: "Breastfeeding promotes early childhood cognitive development, prevents
      young child infections including pneumonia and diarrhea, and improves mental
      and physical health in mothers. That’s why each year during the first week of
      August, [World Breastfeeding Week](https://worldbreastfeedingweek.org) is celebrated
      to raise awareness and promote breastfeeding as the best source of nutrition
      for most babies. \n\nGeneral breastfeeding guidance from the World Health Organization
      (WHO) and other leading health authorities includes breastfeeding for the first
      six months of life all the way to two years of age and beyond.\n\nUnfortunately,
      misinformation about breastfeeding is widespread. Claims often center around:\n\n-
      Foods breastfeeding mothers should or should not eat (In general, [breastfeeding
      moms](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/diet-and-micronutrients/maternal-diet.html)
      should eat a varied diet and don’t need to include or avoid specific foods except
      for some seafood that may be high in mercury.)\n\n- If exercise changes the
      taste of breastmilk ([Exercise](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      is healthy and has not been shown to change the taste of breastmilk.)\n\n- Whether
      negative emotions affect breastmilk quality (Breastmilk quality [doesn’t change](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      based on mom’s emotions.)\n\n- Whether it is okay for a mother to breastfeed
      if she is ill ([In most cases](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding),
      moms should continue to breastfeed even when they’re ill because breastmilk
      passes on immune defense to the baby, but there are some exceptions so always
      check with your or your baby’s doctor.)\n \nExacerbating the issue, early in
      the coronavirus pandemic incomplete scientific consensus and confusion resulted
      in brand new types of breastfeeding [misinformation](https://www.iol.co.za/lifestyle/family/baby/covid-19-moms-and-breastfeeding-separating-facts-from-fiction-add70b6c-9821-4471-8297-67e69947c5b1).
      Because little was known about the virus, many feared that the virus would spread
      from mothers to their infants through [breastmilk](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      and those concerns were shared widely in online communities. \n\nOffline challenges
      of COVID-19 have also taken hold. Lockdown limits access to pre- and postnatal
      lactation support [services](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
      leaving mothers vulnerable to online or familial misinformation in the absence
      of professional breastfeeding support. Some women have been [advised](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036629/)
      by doctors not to breastfeed or to stop breastfeeding. \n\nIn some cases, babies
      [were](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
      separated from mothers in hospitals, a practice known to make establishing breastfeeding
      [difficult](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html),
      decrease breastfeeding [success](https://trends.hms.harvard.edu/2020/03/31/covid-19-separating-infected-mothers-from-newborns-weighing-the-risks-and-benefits/),
      inhibit [early bonding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27885658/) and attachment,
      and [negatively impact maternal mental health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842365/).
      Finally, some reports have also suggested that formula companies began further
      undermining breastfeeding messages by promoting formula as safer than breastmilk
      during the pandemic.\n \nNow, eight months into the pandemic, we have improved
      understanding and data, so breastfeeding recommendations for mothers infected
      with COVID-19 are clearer. Despite misinformation, while studies of breastmilk
      and breastfeeding are ongoing, current research shows that the risk of an infant
      becoming infected with COVID-19 through breast milk is low. \nThe WHO [suggests](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      that “at this point, it appears that COVID-19 in infants and children represents
      a much lower threat to survival and health than other infections that breastfeeding
      is protective against.” Meanwhile the threat of poor health outcomes as a result
      of not breastfeeding is [particularly true](https://www.bfmed.org/assets/DOCUMENTS/abm-position-breastfeeding.pdf)
      in areas where access to clean water and medical care are limited.\n \nFor those
      on the front lines who are supporting moms and babies everyday, providing encouragement,
      addressing misinformation, and empowering mothers to make well-informed feeding
      decisions, are a huge part of providing high-quality care. While babies are
      not immune from contracting COVID-19, based on the current evidence the WHO
      advises that even with suspected or confirmed maternal COVID-19, breastfeeding
      is recommended for infants and young children. The U.S. Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention further advise mothers to further discuss breastfeeding
      with their healthcare providers.\n \nResources:\n[World Alliance for Breastfeeding.

    body: "A few weeks ago, in a WhatsApp message group with family members, a forwarded
      message showed up on my screen that read: “The COVID-19 plot thickens, please
      do read.” \n \nIn India, where my family is from, it is typical for a day to
      begin with five or more messages in different family or work WhatsApp groups.
      The messages range from friendly updates and innocent gifs to threads pressuring
      you to forward messages to nine people in order to avoid ill-fated planetary
      alignments.\n \nWhat followed the COVID-19 message a few weeks ago was an elaborate
      thread containing false claims about COVID-19 as a lab-made virus, intended
      to boost the sales of Remdesivir and benefit Bill Gates and George Soros. The
      forwarded text falsely claimed that the entire COVID-19 crisis is a well-orchestrated
      effort at the highest levels by Gates, Soros, Obama, and Clinton to develop
      a COVID-19 vaccine, with “the ultimate motivation of making billions of dollars
      in profits at the cost of only losing a mere million human lives.” This particular
      conspiracy theory was disseminated on Facebook in the United States, and quickly
      spread through WhatsApp in India as well.\n \nIn the United States, journalists
      are battling misinformation on open or partially open social platforms like
      Facebook and Twitter. In India, as in other parts of the world, the problem
      may be trickier to catch—and harder to prevent, because misinformation spreads
      predominantly in closed chat groups on WhatsApp, away from the sights of content
      moderators and fact-checkers.  Blatant misinformation campaigns like the one
      I received recently are dangerous under normal circumstances, and downright
      deadly in the midst of a pandemic. Misinformation makes it harder for healthcare
      authorities to effectively communicate critical health information to wider
      audiences.\n \nWhatsApp misinformation in India sows distrust in healthcare
      institutions and encourages disregard for basic public health advice. Often
      disguised as medical advice, doctored videos of a prominent Indian doctor advising
      viewers not to get tested for coronavirus were circulated over 5,000 times on
      Facebook and Twitter. False rumors have led to many Indian doctors and frontline
      healthcare workers being evicted from their homes. This is especially important
      in the Indian context, where unfiltered and inaccurate information spreads rapidly
      on WhatsApp, and can quickly hamper efforts to trace, isolate, and care for
      COVID cases. Healthcare workers attempting to stop the spread of COVID-19 have
      been attacked by mobs across India as recently as April, and misinformation
      has only exacerbated the violence.\n \nIn March 2020, one particular message
      circulating on WhatsApp caught the attention of the Government of India’s Press
      Information Bureau (PIB). The message falsely claimed that the Government was
      spraying “CV vaccine gas inside the country, through airplanes.”\n \nThe official
      Twitter account of PIB (@PIBFactCheck) responded by stating: “Amidst #Coronavirusoutbreak,
      misinformation on CV Vaccine gas spread out through Airplanes is circulating
      on social media. NO such action has been planned out by the Indian Government.
      Get your facts from trusted sources. Do not amplify #fakenews!”\n \nAge-old
      rumors about vaccine safety are now being tailored to COVID-19 audiences to
      promote vaccine hesitancy, which could derail efforts not only for the eventual
      implementation of a COVID-19 vaccine, but also for the continuation of routine
      vaccinations for myriad other diseases.\n \nThe misinformation amid the pandemic
      is not limited to vaccine hesitancy. In some  parts of India, the indigenous
      cow has been elevated to new heights and questionable treatments, such as cow
      urine, have been marketed as an effective remedy against the novel coronavirus.
      Such claims may have gained legitimacy under the current Government, which created
      an open call for research & development proposals that examine dubious pseudo-scientific
      treatments such as “cowpathy” for “medicine and health” in February this year.
      In such circumstances, it becomes even more difficult to distinguish science
      from pseudoscience in a pandemic, especially as misinformation seems to travel
      even faster than COVID-19 in India.\n \nIn Mizoram, approximately 15 individuals
      were arrested for spreading a fictitious and official-sounding directive from
      state officials, asking local citizens from outside Mizoram to return home at
      once. Similar arrests have taken place in Rajasthan, Odisha, and other Indian
      states. Successive state governments have responded to misinformation by conducting
      mass arrests rather than tackling the problem at its root by improving health
      communication in localized languages.\n \nEffective health communication in
      a pandemic requires systematic investments in health infrastructure and adequate
      training for academics and journalists. Fortunately, many organizations are
      meeting this gap and providing resources and responses to tackle such misinformation.
      Organizations such as SciLine, the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN),
      and COVID Explained have developed several resources, unpacking claims about
      COVID-19. While many such projects focus on general misinformation related to
      COVID-19, there is an increased need for addressing vaccine misinformation specifically,
      and to provide the context needed for individuals that speak a variety of different
      languages, with varying health literacy levels.\n  \nThere is a paucity of evidence-based
      information for journalists, fact-checkers and everyday WhatsApp users to effectively
      unpack disingenuous claims, whether it be anti-vaccine propaganda or the marketing
      of natural and herbal remedies as cures for the coronavirus.\n \nIndia has detected
      1.2 million cases and 30,000 deaths of COVID-19, according to the Ministry of
      Health & Family Welfare. Given the difficulties around active surveillance in
      India, experts believe the actual number could be even higher. Even if official
      estimates are to be believed, however, the contagion of misinformation threatens
      to derail existing efforts and present roadblocks to the development of a future
      vaccine.\n \nIt is now more imperative than ever before to prioritize effective
      health communication in order to tackle the scourge of misinformation, especially
      as we double down on efforts to rein in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n \n*Mohit Nair

    body: "The proliferation of misinformation and disinformation online throughout
      the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly yielded a corresponding ‘infodemic.’ Information
      around the novel coronavirus is shifting daily and narratives vary based on
      the contexts in which we live, work and socialize.  \n\nThis creates a near-perfect
      recipe for a confusing, substandard information ecosystem and intentionally
      false information. Mis- and disinformation related to the pandemic is not just
      \ harmful for individuals, but, because of the nature of the virus, low-quality
      information also adversely impacts the collective and directly contributes to
      greater numbers of cases and deaths. \n\nAs both a graduate student pursuing
      an MPH at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and as a young person
      raised in the American South, I’ve had a lens into two contrasting sides of
      the COVID-19 online informational arena. On the one hand, I have access to some
      of the highest-quality and timely information on the pandemic. On the other,
      I have a lens into American skepticism of the CDC and WHO, and clear gaps in
      which  public health authorities  (such as from Harvard Chan, the CDC, and WHO
      themselves), are not effectively reaching the general public, particularly in
      the digital realm. \n\nMisinformation is highly challenging to regulate, often
      because it spreads  informally across a range of social media platforms. Evidence
      shows that traditional public health interventions on social media, which present
      text-heavy facts on platforms, are inadequate for obtaining wide-reach. This
      becomes particularly clear when those interventions are compared to the reach
      of mis- and disinformation. Exacerbating this challenge is the fact that news
      sources are often not staffed with in-house public health experts, and given
      that, there are significant bottlenecks within academia that preclude a free-flowing
      stream of the most up-to-date health information for journalists.\n\nIn order
      to address this set of challenges, student group Students Against COVID-19 (SAC)
      and [Meedan's COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/) are
      partnering to pair the latest expert health information with digestible infographics
      tailored to online spaces and resharing. Through the partnership, SAC will leverage
      the Meedan Digital Health Lab’s team of experts to translate their most recent
      COVID-19 updates and answers to pressing questions into highly accessible visuals
      particularly intended for online audiences globally. Graphics will be posted
      alongside expert answers on the [learnaboutcovid19.org](http://learnaboutcovid19.org/)
      database for easy viewing and sharing. This pairing of content and visuals has
      the potential for broad impact in mitigating health misinformation online and,
      in turn, improved public health outcomes. \n\n![Zoonotic Diseases](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3hzT12rbPNOOF4inKiGxzp/763ba6cb8a26539ddcd96eebb4e9adaa/Screen_Shot_2020-06-26_at_2.56.45_PM.png)!

      arm, a remnant of an injury from over 9 months ago. When the COVID-19 pandemic
      hit, changing all of our plans, it understandably delayed non-essential medical
      procedures like the one I needed.\n \nJuly 2020 marks [30 years since the passage
      of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/30th_anniversary/index.html).
      Twelve years ago the [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
      (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html)
      came into effect, which was the first United Nations (UN) human rights treaty
      of the 21st century, and also the UN convention with the largest number of signatories
      in history on its opening day.  \n\nAs I recover, I am reflecting on what these
      mean for my friends and colleagues with disabilities, including disabilities
      that are permanent or longer-term than my own. \n\nWe have made progress through
      high-level decisions and cultural shifts. For example, plans for people with
      disabilities are now included in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, the
      Paris Agreement on Global Climate Change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster
      Risk Reduction, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development.
      Yet there is much more to do  – we still have not achieved universal access,
      and people with disabilities are being disproportionately affected by the COVID-19
      pandemic in multiple ways.\n\n- People with disabilities are at a higher risk
      of severe symptoms and death from COVID-19. A [study published in the *Disability
      and Health Journal*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245650/)
      found that there is a higher COVID-19 fatality rate among people with intellectual
      and developmental disabilities (IDD). The researchers also found a higher concentration
      of COVID-19 cases at younger ages for people with IDD. Last month, the American
      Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) shared [devastating statistics](https://www.aclu.org/news/disability-rights/covid-19-deaths-in-nursing-homes-are-not-unavoidable-they-are-the-result-of-deadly-discrimination/)
      on the anniversary of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v.
      L.C., which recognized that unjustified segregation of people with disabilities
      is a form of discrimination: Nearly 50% of COVID-19 deaths have been among people
      living in nursing homes, psychiatric hospitals, and other congregate settings
      for people with disabilities, while this population only makes up less than
      1% of the U.S. population. The ACLU warns us that these excess and inequitable
      deaths are “not unavoidable – they are the result of deadly discrimination.”\n\n-
      People with disabilities are also excluded as much of our world moves online
      during the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting everything from education and employment
      to essential services and social connection. There is [growing worldwide concern](https://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=2322)
      about the digital divide, where many people still lack access to technologies
      like computers and smartphones, not to mention affordable as well as reliable
      internet and even electricity. The most affected tend to be [lower-income](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/07/digital-divide-persists-even-as-lower-income-americans-make-gains-in-tech-adoption/),
      [older generations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/technology/virus-older-generation-digital-divide.html),
      [racial and ethnic minorities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/20/smartphones-help-blacks-hispanics-bridge-some-but-not-all-digital-gaps-with-whites/),
      [sexual and gender minorities](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/GenderDigital/HRBDT_submission.pdf),
      and [people with disabilities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/07/disabled-americans-are-less-likely-to-use-technology/),
      with many intersectionalities. Exacerbating this, people with disabilities can
      face additional barriers, such as:\n\n\n1.   Increased risks of online harassment
      and discrimination\n\n2.   Lack of adaptations for limited abilities to see,
      hear, and understand content\n\n3.  Lack of adaptations for limited physical
      abilities to use devices (ex.    following my injury, I learned to type using
      one hand supplemented with voice recognition software)\n\nIt is more crucial
      than ever to mitigate barriers like these during a pandemic, where online access
      to quality information and essential activities can directly influence health
      outcomes.\n\nHere at Meedan, the Digital Health Lab is working to address “viral
      misinformation that facilitates the spread of a particular health outcome or
      disease,” also called a “misinfodemic,” by increasing access to expert-sourced
      information about COVID-19. \n\nMeedan’s efforts to increase access include
      avoiding jargon to make information readable by the general public, providing
      a glossary with simplified definitions of scientific terms, translating information
      for non-English speakers, and disseminating information across diverse media
      channels. In this process, we cannot forget to include people with disabilities.
      Leaving out people with disabilities means hurting a significant proportion
      of humanity: The World Health Organization (WHO) [estimates that over 1 billion](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health)
      people experience some form of disability. Additionally, the ADA and CRPD require
      making online content, services, and systems accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nEquality
      under the law does not automatically translate to equity in everyday practice.
      We have to do the hard work of building the inclusive world we’d like to see,
      and we need to continuously work on addressing ableism and centering disability
      justice. Meedan’s Digital Health Lab is striving to increase access to COVID-19
      information for all, including people with disabilities, and we invite you to
      join us.\n\nResources:\n\n[ADA Best Practices Chapter 5 Website Accessibility](https://www.ada.gov/pcatoolkit/chap5toolkit.htm)\n[Federal

    body: "Breastfeeding promotes early childhood cognitive development, prevents
      young child infections including pneumonia and diarrhea, and improves mental
      and physical health in mothers. That’s why each year during the first week of
      August, [World Breastfeeding Week](https://worldbreastfeedingweek.org) is celebrated
      to raise awareness and promote breastfeeding as the best source of nutrition
      for most babies. \n\nGeneral breastfeeding guidance from the World Health Organization
      (WHO) and other leading health authorities includes breastfeeding for the first
      six months of life all the way to two years of age and beyond.\n\nUnfortunately,
      misinformation about breastfeeding is widespread. Claims often center around:\n\n-
      Foods breastfeeding mothers should or should not eat (In general, [breastfeeding
      moms](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/diet-and-micronutrients/maternal-diet.html)
      should eat a varied diet and don’t need to include or avoid specific foods except
      for some seafood that may be high in mercury.)\n\n- If exercise changes the
      taste of breastmilk ([Exercise](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      is healthy and has not been shown to change the taste of breastmilk.)\n\n- Whether
      negative emotions affect breastmilk quality (Breastmilk quality [doesn’t change](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      based on mom’s emotions.)\n\n- Whether it is okay for a mother to breastfeed
      if she is ill ([In most cases](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding),
      moms should continue to breastfeed even when they’re ill because breastmilk
      passes on immune defense to the baby, but there are some exceptions so always
      check with your or your baby’s doctor.)\n \nExacerbating the issue, early in
      the coronavirus pandemic incomplete scientific consensus and confusion resulted
      in brand new types of breastfeeding [misinformation](https://www.iol.co.za/lifestyle/family/baby/covid-19-moms-and-breastfeeding-separating-facts-from-fiction-add70b6c-9821-4471-8297-67e69947c5b1).
      Because little was known about the virus, many feared that the virus would spread
      from mothers to their infants through [breastmilk](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      and those concerns were shared widely in online communities. \n\nOffline challenges
      of COVID-19 have also taken hold. Lockdown limits access to pre- and postnatal
      lactation support [services](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
      leaving mothers vulnerable to online or familial misinformation in the absence
      of professional breastfeeding support. Some women have been [advised](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036629/)
      by doctors not to breastfeed or to stop breastfeeding. \n\nIn some cases, babies
      [were](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
      separated from mothers in hospitals, a practice known to make establishing breastfeeding
      [difficult](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html),
      decrease breastfeeding [success](https://trends.hms.harvard.edu/2020/03/31/covid-19-separating-infected-mothers-from-newborns-weighing-the-risks-and-benefits/),
      inhibit [early bonding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27885658/) and attachment,
      and [negatively impact maternal mental health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842365/).
      Finally, some reports have also suggested that formula companies began further
      undermining breastfeeding messages by promoting formula as safer than breastmilk
      during the pandemic.\n \nNow, eight months into the pandemic, we have improved
      understanding and data, so breastfeeding recommendations for mothers infected
      with COVID-19 are clearer. Despite misinformation, while studies of breastmilk
      and breastfeeding are ongoing, current research shows that the risk of an infant
      becoming infected with COVID-19 through breast milk is low. \nThe WHO [suggests](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      that “at this point, it appears that COVID-19 in infants and children represents
      a much lower threat to survival and health than other infections that breastfeeding
      is protective against.” Meanwhile the threat of poor health outcomes as a result
      of not breastfeeding is [particularly true](https://www.bfmed.org/assets/DOCUMENTS/abm-position-breastfeeding.pdf)
      in areas where access to clean water and medical care are limited.\n \nFor those
      on the front lines who are supporting moms and babies everyday, providing encouragement,
      addressing misinformation, and empowering mothers to make well-informed feeding
      decisions, are a huge part of providing high-quality care. While babies are
      not immune from contracting COVID-19, based on the current evidence the WHO
      advises that even with suspected or confirmed maternal COVID-19, breastfeeding
      is recommended for infants and young children. The U.S. Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention further advise mothers to further discuss breastfeeding
      with their healthcare providers.\n \nResources:\n[World Alliance for Breastfeeding.
