    body: |-
      Early in the days of COVID-19, as it was just starting to leave the confines of East Asia, a number of people I know started calling the then-emergent pandemic a "black swan event." This is a metaphor for something very rare and difficult to predict. It would be a fitting one if COVID-19 was like the Spanish Flu---a once in a century event that wreaks havoc and then is quickly forgotten. It's become popular in finance circles thanks to the work of options trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb. As summarized in Wikipedia, [Black swan theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) has three key charateristics:

      1.  The disproportionate role of high-profile, hard-to-predict, and rare events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations in history, science, finance, and technology.

      2.  The non-computability of the probability of the consequential rare events using scientific methods (owing to the very nature of small probabilities).

      3.  The psychological biases that blind people, both individually and collectively, to uncertainty and to a rare event's massive role in historical affairs.

      A striking image --- just because we've never seen a black swan doesn't mean it doesn't exist ---, it's wholly inadequate for understanding COVID-19. [An article in Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90475793/why-the-coronavirus-crisis-is-a-gray-rhino-and-not-a-black-swan) helped me understand and dispense with that metaphor pretty quickly:

      > But true linguists say that the proper metaphor for the crisis is a "gray rhino," which refers to highly probable but neglected threats that have an enormous impact. It was coined by Michele Wucker, a policy analyst who came up with the term after the 2012 Greek financial crisis.

      Indeed, nearly two years ago,[  Atlantic writer Ed Yong pointed out that the US](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/when-the-next-plague-hits/561734/)---and, as we've learned, the world---is simply not ready for a pandemic:

      > Perhaps most important, the U.S. is prone to the same forgetfulness and shortsightedness that befall all nations, rich and poor---and the myopia has worsened considerably in recent years. Public-health programs are low on money; hospitals are stretched perilously thin; crucial funding is being slashed. And while we tend to think of science when we think of pandemic response, the worse the situation, the more the defense depends on political leadership.

      > When Ebola flared in 2014, the science-minded President Barack Obama calmly and quickly took the reins. The White House is now home to a president who is neither calm nor science-minded. We should not underestimate what that may mean if risk becomes reality.

      ![This pandemic isn’t a swan—it’s a canary](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/6hTpSXjNGPRuVKV4KnuGZs/08f9b2b3458c7197cff220daed69a6f6/EF3E3911-3032-4865-AC7A-D096912D60ED.JPG)

      Many have seen this rhino coming. It was standing there all along. As early as 2017, [the Pentagon was aware of the risks](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/05/827692672/report-pentagon-aware-of-possible-coronavirus-threat-for-years), and the film [Contagion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contagion_(2011_film)), shot in 2011 and depicting a global pandemic and its effects on common people and institutions alike, feels eerily prescient but is only predictive because it's based on solid science about pandemic risk.

      But as I learn more about the pandemic and the conditions that enabled it to spread so quickly---poor public health systems, science denialism, and the steady encroachment of humans onto animal environments, among other factors---I think another metaphor is more fitting: the canary in the coal mine.

      Consider the words of health writer Sonia Shah [in a recent cover story for The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/pandemic-definition-covid/):

      > It's time for a new story, one that more accurately captures the reality of how contagions unfold and why. In this story, pandemics would be cast as both a biological reality and a social phenomenon shaped by human agency. And the coronavirus, if cast as any kind of monster at all, would be a Frankenstein's monster: a creature of our own making. We, after all, created the world in which SARS-Cov-2 evolved, one in which our industry has swallowed up so much of the planet that microbes from wild animals easily slip into livestock and humans. We created the society of overcrowded prisons and nursing homes staffed by underpaid employees who must work in multiple facilities to make ends meet; in which employers force their workers to labor on meatpacking lines even if they're sick; in which asylum seekers are crammed into detention centers; and in which people living in hard-hit cities like Detroit lack access to clean water with which to wash their hands.

      > A narrative that elevates these realities would compel us to consider a much wider range of policy responses to counter the threat of pandemics. Instead of blaming outsiders and waiting for magic bullet cures, we could work to enhance our resilience and reduce the probability of pathogens reaching us in the first place. Instead of reflexively demanding that killing chemicals be slathered across the landscape to destroy mosquitoes infected by the West Nile virus and ticks infected with Lyme disease bacteria, we could restore the lost biodiversity that once prevented their spread. We could protect the forests where bats roost, so that Ebola, SARS, and other viruses stay in them and don't find their way into human populations.

      The phrase "canary in a coal mine" comes from an English-language metaphor based on the fact that canaries--which are more susceptible to methane than human beings--were brought to mines as a precaution. If the canary died, it meant methane was leaking, and that people needed to evacuate immediately. The canary was a warning that something was wrong with the mine, and that greater danger lay ahead.

      Instead of a black swan or a gray rhino, we might call COVID-19 a yellow canary event --- an event that warns of even greater dangers to come.  Like the real-world canary in the coal mine, the death of something we like is a sign that something is fundamentally wrong with the metaphorical mine we live in.

      We might consider yellow canary event as having some of the following characteristics:

      -   A signal that is itself disturbing but to an expert is doubly so because of the conditions it reveals;

      -   Hurts vulnerable populations and systems first, in a highly visible way;

      -   Exposes a structural weakness that will cause tremendous harm to everyone if allowed to continue

      This is COVID-19: it is a biological entity with sociological roots and geopolitical effects. And as it harms black, indigenous and people of color and global south communities more than others, as it strikes the elderly and the infirm and the underpaid and migrants, and as the response becomes politicized, we are reaping the consequences of many significant societal problems. It's not a coincidence that Black Lives Matter and other social movements are rising now --- the pandemic is the yellow canary for the fissures we've allowed to form in society that have generally been ignored.

      The misinfodemics around the pandemic are deeply intertwined with these challenges. [In a 2018 article in The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/), colleague Nat Gyenes and I looked at some of the underlying conditions that have created a field of risk: search engine algorithms and social media feeds based on attention, long-running distrust in science, the complexity with which science is communicated. Much of public health, we wrote, "remains focused on providing communications guidelines and engaging in traditional broadcast-diffusion strategies, but not search-engine optimization, viral marketing campaigns, and accessing populations through social-diffusion approaches."

      COVID-19 is a yellow canary event for the kind of environmental destruction we should expect globally, the racial and global inequalities we've allowed and encouraged to fester, the information ecosystems we've funded through advertising, and a long-running denialism of both the social and biological sciences. When miners see a dead canary, they know it's time to evacuate. But in the context of a global pandemic, there's nowhere else to go. We have to face it, understand the underlying causes, and do our best to change them.

    body: "Breastfeeding promotes early childhood cognitive development, prevents
      young child infections including pneumonia and diarrhea, and improves mental
      and physical health in mothers. That’s why each year during the first week of
      August, [World Breastfeeding Week](https://worldbreastfeedingweek.org) is celebrated
      to raise awareness and promote breastfeeding as the best source of nutrition
      for most babies. \n\nGeneral breastfeeding guidance from the World Health Organization
      (WHO) and other leading health authorities includes breastfeeding for the first
      six months of life all the way to two years of age and beyond.\n\nUnfortunately,
      misinformation about breastfeeding is widespread. Claims often center around:\n\n-
      Foods breastfeeding mothers should or should not eat (In general, [breastfeeding
      moms](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/diet-and-micronutrients/maternal-diet.html)
      should eat a varied diet and don’t need to include or avoid specific foods except
      for some seafood that may be high in mercury.)\n\n- If exercise changes the
      taste of breastmilk ([Exercise](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      is healthy and has not been shown to change the taste of breastmilk.)\n\n- Whether
      negative emotions affect breastmilk quality (Breastmilk quality [doesn’t change](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      based on mom’s emotions.)\n\n- Whether it is okay for a mother to breastfeed
      if she is ill ([In most cases](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding),
      moms should continue to breastfeed even when they’re ill because breastmilk
      passes on immune defense to the baby, but there are some exceptions so always
      check with your or your baby’s doctor.)\n \nExacerbating the issue, early in
      the coronavirus pandemic incomplete scientific consensus and confusion resulted
      in brand new types of breastfeeding [misinformation](https://www.iol.co.za/lifestyle/family/baby/covid-19-moms-and-breastfeeding-separating-facts-from-fiction-add70b6c-9821-4471-8297-67e69947c5b1).
      Because little was known about the virus, many feared that the virus would spread
      from mothers to their infants through [breastmilk](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      and those concerns were shared widely in online communities. \n\nOffline challenges
      of COVID-19 have also taken hold. Lockdown limits access to pre- and postnatal
      lactation support [services](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
      leaving mothers vulnerable to online or familial misinformation in the absence
      of professional breastfeeding support. Some women have been [advised](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036629/)
      by doctors not to breastfeed or to stop breastfeeding. \n\nIn some cases, babies
      [were](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
      separated from mothers in hospitals, a practice known to make establishing breastfeeding
      [difficult](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html),
      decrease breastfeeding [success](https://trends.hms.harvard.edu/2020/03/31/covid-19-separating-infected-mothers-from-newborns-weighing-the-risks-and-benefits/),
      inhibit [early bonding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27885658/) and attachment,
      and [negatively impact maternal mental health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842365/).
      Finally, some reports have also suggested that formula companies began further
      undermining breastfeeding messages by promoting formula as safer than breastmilk
      during the pandemic.\n \nNow, eight months into the pandemic, we have improved
      understanding and data, so breastfeeding recommendations for mothers infected
      with COVID-19 are clearer. Despite misinformation, while studies of breastmilk
      and breastfeeding are ongoing, current research shows that the risk of an infant
      becoming infected with COVID-19 through breast milk is low. \nThe WHO [suggests](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      that “at this point, it appears that COVID-19 in infants and children represents
      a much lower threat to survival and health than other infections that breastfeeding
      is protective against.” Meanwhile the threat of poor health outcomes as a result
      of not breastfeeding is [particularly true](https://www.bfmed.org/assets/DOCUMENTS/abm-position-breastfeeding.pdf)
      in areas where access to clean water and medical care are limited.\n \nFor those
      on the front lines who are supporting moms and babies everyday, providing encouragement,
      addressing misinformation, and empowering mothers to make well-informed feeding
      decisions, are a huge part of providing high-quality care. While babies are
      not immune from contracting COVID-19, based on the current evidence the WHO
      advises that even with suspected or confirmed maternal COVID-19, breastfeeding
      is recommended for infants and young children. The U.S. Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention further advise mothers to further discuss breastfeeding
      with their healthcare providers.\n \nResources:\n[World Alliance for Breastfeeding.

    body: "In the 1300s during the Black Plague, before scientists could diagnose
      the cause of the disease (a bacterium now called Yersinia pestis), [religious
      cures, potions and bloodletting](https://www.ancient.eu/article/1540/medieval-cures-for-the-black-death/)
      filled anxiety-inducing gaps in information that contemporary medical knowledge
      could not. Generations later, during the Spanish Flu, before its true biology
      was discovered, even[ many scientists](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2118275/)
      believed wrongly that the disease came from the same bacterium that caused illnesses
      like anthrax, cholera, and plague. Today, in the throes of this pandemic, we
      see similar misinformation surrounding COVID-19 treatments, cures and preventions,
      all spreading across the internet before they’ve been verified or refuted by
      good science. \n\nIn each of these cases, the need or desire to know a truth
      outpaces the discovery of that truth *(\"How much should we be testing? How
      did the virus spread? What are the symptoms? What are the cures?\")*. So people
      make stuff up. They latch onto theories, maybe because bad information and hasty
      news is more comforting than no information at all. It's a problem we might
      call [“midinformation,\"](https://meedan.com/blog/missing-information-not-just-misinformation-is-part-of-the-problem/),
      or informational ambiguity based on scant or conflicting evidence, often about
      emerging scientific knowledge.\n\nThere is a growing global need for a generation
      of journalists who can help the public root through the noise of the internet
      and get to the bottom of the chaos. More than just a baseline need for journalism
      and high quality reporting (which is equally critical and proactive), the failures
      of governments, platforms and information leaders during COVID-19, coupled with
      the public's growing skepticism of science, call for more of us to be able to
      spot midinformation and misinformation, discern its different manifestations,
      debunk claims online, and spread the message. We are hoping to address these
      challenges through Check U, a new vertical at Meedan that trains university
      students to spot and verify misleading information. \n\nThis is important now
      more than ever. Waning public trust in authorities, coupled with an evolving
      disease in which research and science changes daily, is predictably sowing confusion,
      and opening gaps for bad actors to manipulate online narratives. We’re seeing
      this virtually everywhere. \n\n- In the Philippines, top leaders [spread misinformation](https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-manila-vice-mayor-lacuna-demos-wrong-w)
      about how to properly wear masks in public\n\n- In India, health misinformation
      is [intertwined](https://meedan.com/reports/coronavirus-misinformation-in-india-is-not-limited-to-health-misinformation/)
      with existing divided narratives between Hindus and Muslims and people are confused
      by false information about ayurvedic “cures”\n\n- Governments around the world[
      are not communicating health information](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/covid-19-minority-languages)
      in minority languages\n\n- In Tribal regions in the United States and Canada,
      government guidelines are [widely out of touch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/06/09/systemic-inequities-increase-covid-19-risk-indigenous-people-canada)
      with the reality of indigenous, community-centered living\n\nThe gaps are slightly
      different in every region, but the trend is observable across language, demographics
      and other divides: people are in need of high quality health information, not
      just because of the general and obvious importance of being able to discern
      what’s true from what’s false, but because knowing things about health [leads
      to doing things about health](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10810730.2013.768727).
      Literally. Knowing the ground truth about vaccine safety [can lead to](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X1500506X)
      getting vaccinated. Knowing the public health benefits of mask wearing [has
      been shown](https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/2020-economic-commentaries/ec-202020-survey-results-on-mask-wearing-behaviors-and-beliefs.aspx)
      to contribute to people wearing masks. If your information is wrong, unrealistic,
      misleading, or inaccessible because of language or literacy, then the things
      you’ll do with that information (or lack thereof it) [may be](https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/social-determinants-health/interventions-resources/health-literacy)
      incorrect and unsafe. Conspiracy theories about vaccination lead people I know
      not only to not vaccinate, but to also spread those conspiracy theories so that
      others don’t vaccinate either.\n\nThrough [Credibility Coalition](https://credibilitycoalition.org/credcatalog/),
      our joint program with Hacks/Hackers, we’re launching a Google News Initiative-supported
      series of Fall 2020 training programs in which students from Germany, Yemen,
      Syria, Cairo, the United States and other places learn critical debunking skills
      amid a century-defining pandemic. All together, we’ll be training more than
      1,100 students from 14 universities. To this end, we’re doing the following:\n\n-
      Developing a syllabus with Syracuse University’s [Jennifer Grygiel](https://newhouse.syr.edu/faculty-staff/jennifer-grygiel)
      \n\n- Walking students through sourcing, screening, categorizing and debunking
      claims\n\n- Using [Check](https://meedan.com/check), Meedan’s online verification
      tool, as a collaborative education platform on which to train and evaluate students
      \n\nToday’s online environment exacerbates the spread of all forms of misleading
      content by amplifying false or understudied theories, leading to poor health
      outcomes worldwide. The internet's decentralization of information, and ensuing
      decentralization of information authority triggers a big chunk of the spread
      of what's now known as [misinfodemics](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/).
      It also calls for solutions that are as powerful and scaleable as the problem
      itself.\n\nThis is just the beginning of our efforts to educate professionals
      and students about responsible ways to debunk claims related to topics as critical
      as our own health and well-being. It builds off many years of Meedan experience
      in this realm, from our initial collaboration with the University of Hong Kong’s
      Cyber Verification Lab to UC Berkeley’s Human Rights Center to our ONA Challenge
      Grant project with the University of Nevada Reno’s Reynolds School of Journalism.
      These lessons have taught us that the act of fact-checking and verification
      is one of the best tools for learning about these processes, and we’re excited
      to formalize this at a new level."

      As the world slowly starts to open up (or not), we've entered a new pandemic stage: confusion. Where once the most solid advice was simply to stay indoors and avoid others, we seem to be encountering a panoply of recommendations. Wash your hands. Masks aren't needed. Wear a mask. Stay six feet away. Actually, it might be airborne, so stay outside too. Take a test. Don't take a test, because supplies are limited.

      In the world of public health, this liminal stage we find ourselves in --- moving past lockdown but nowhere near reaching either a social or medical endpoint to the pandemic --- is often the most dangerous for a disease's spread. In 1918, the city of San Francisco had the fewest reported cases of Spanish Flu in the country thanks to strict social distancing practices. The city and the people declared victory, emerged from lockdown, and returned to normal life. By the end of the year, the city had one of the worst infection and mortality rates in the US, [with 45,000 cases and more than 3,000 deaths](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/san-francisco-had-1918-flu-under-control-then-it-lifted-n1191141).

      In the world of information trust, this liminal stage presents another threat: epistemic ambiguity. The usual model for misleading information is two fold: there's misinformation --- false information spread unintentionally --- and disinformation --- false information spread with the intent of harm. We've certainly seen this with COVID-19. [Misinfodemics](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/), the spread of false information that exacerbates the spread of disease, have erupted around [drinking bleach](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/06/americans-are-drinking-bleach-and-dunking-food-in-it-to-prevent-covid-19/) or [methanol](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/iran-700-dead-drinking-alcohol-cure-coronavirus-200427163529629.html), having immunity [based on race](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-14/no-black-people-aren-t-immune-to-covid-19), and countless other bits of misinformation, leading to hospitalizations and even deaths.

      From a fact-checking perspective, this is relatively straightforward. Health professionals *know* bleach and methanol don't cure COVID-19. But the problem is in the murky areas, when fact-checking is being done in good faith but the extant body of knowledge is limited and evolving.

      Take an example from this summer. In June, an official from the World Health Organization COVID-19 [caused significant public confusion](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2020/who-comments-on-asymptomatic-covid-19-transmission-is-lesson-in-research-and-context/) by saying that asymptomatic spread of novel coronavirus is rare. [As Poynter's Al Tompkins wrote](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2020/who-comments-on-asymptomatic-covid-19-transmission-is-lesson-in-research-and-context/), this statement could "light new fires among people who believe the entire COVID-19 pandemic has been overblown and that there was no need for stay-at-home orders that keep seemingly healthy people at home." The next day, the WHO issued a clarification: the researcher was referring to emergent data from a small set of studies.

      So much more is being learned about the virus. We don't know right now if [people can be reinfected or not](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/can-someone-get-reinfected-and-get-covid-19-a-second-time/#undefined). Experts are debating whether [there's airborne transmission](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02058-1). We're still learning about [the role of vitamins](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/does-vitamin-d-help-prevent-or-treat-covid-19/). And it's not just that we don't know --- it's that no one knows. Science hasn't caught up yet. Do we wear a mask or not wear a mask? It's obvious now that we should, but just a few months ago, even respected bodies like the WHO and CDC were [offering conflicting advice](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/cdc-offer-conflicting-advice-masks-expert-tells-us/story?id=70958380).

      It turns out that the framework of mis- and disinformation has a basic assumption that doesn't always apply in the case of COVID-19: the idea that there might be a ground truth, somewhere, at some point, that someone might have in some situation. [As I've written before](https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/12/the-death-of-consensus-not-the-death-of-truth/), the process of consensus-making requires a negotiation of truth through trusted parties and sources (and therefore subject to the rules of trust, emotion and relatability).

      But what if the information we're trying to discuss isn't known by anyone?


      ## Midinformation: When knowledge stands in the middle, what do we do?

      In the case of emerging knowledge, it might be helpful to think not just about misinformation but *mid*information. We know a little now, we'll know more later, and we may never know everything ever. In other words, information stands in the middle, and we're trying. Scientists are gaining some clarity, but it's going to take some time for scientific consensus to build, and for public understanding to catch up.

      Midinformation, in other words, is the sort of information crisis that happens when not all the facts are known. In that vacuum of knowledge, all kinds of rumors, conspiracies, misunderstandings and misconceptions can emerge, because it's comforting to have an anchor that feels true and reliable.

      **We might define midinformation as informational ambiguity based on scant or conflicting evidence, often about emerging scientific knowledge.** And the COVID-19 pandemic is rife with it. The usual media literacy course teaches basic things: vet your sources, look for corroborating evidence, [read laterally](https://webliteracy.pressbooks.com/chapter/what-reading-laterally-means/). But the phenomenon of midinformation requires new skills, for journalists, educators and all of us.

      Here are some:

      ### __Take a breather.__

      This one's obvious, but in an attention economy, it's harder and harder to resist checking the news. Doomscrolling, as [WIRED writer Angela Watercutter](https://www.wired.com/story/stop-doomscrolling/) has pointed out, makes us *feel* better prepared for what's going on, but it might actually be hurting us.

      > Right now, people are living at a time with no easy solutions, a moment with a lot of conflicting "facts" in a rapidly changing landscape. According to Nicole Ellison, who studies communication and social media at the University of Michigan's School of Information, that means there's a "lot of demand on cognitive processing to make sense of this. There's no overarching narrative that helps us." That, she adds, only compounds the stress and anxiety they're already feeling.

      Watercutter points out that COVID-19 isn't a sprint; it's a marathon. We have to take care of our mental health, recognize when our attention to the news might be destructive, and to remember that resolution to the pandemic will take time, at the scale of years, not months or weeks. To curb my own doomscrolling habit, I've been reading books and putting my phone away before going to bed.

      ### __We're doing science in public --- help people understand that.__

      The experience of the WHO researcher reflects a reality for every public health researcher: there's often no data, and when there is data, it's not validated or vetted, and it might even be in conflict with other studies. The scientific method demands replicability of results, but this process can take months, if not years, far slower than a typical news cycle and certainly much slower than the lightning speed of viral media. "We're six months into a pandemic," she said in her public clarification. "There's a huge amount of research that is being done, but we don't have that full picture yet."

      <p class="caption">Book Talk and Webinar: Keep Calm and Log On with author Gus Andrews</p>

      In a recent conversation I had [with author Gus Andrews](https://www.keepcalmlogon.com/about-author-gillian-gus-andrews), I asked her about how we deal this. Because of significant scientific advances in the fields of physics, chemistry and astronomy, we're used to the idea of scientific consensus on key topics.

      But this is a novel coronavirus, and we're doing science in public now, she said. That means heated debates, scant data, papers that haven't been subject to peer review, and all kinds of conversations usually limited to experts but now exposed to the public by the pandemic given the enormous interest in the topic. It's vital that we help each other along in understanding what a lack of scientific consensus looks like, and [how to navigate the waters of an infodemic](https://www.yalemedicine.org/stories/covid-19-infodemic/).

      And remember to focus on what we do know: stay at home as much as possible, wear a mask if you go out, etc. It's important that we not let the inevitable confusion that arises from midinformation to in turn foster information nihilism.

      ### __Bring audiences along on the journey.__

      Here's what Gus had to say: "I wonder if we can give more people the feeling that they're part of the evolving discussion by encouraging them to keep listening and educating themselves on the latest narratives. Which maybe even unfolds like a podcast or other series, where there's value and a feeling of safety in becoming part of the community that keeps engaging. We're all learning, together, and we become stronger by doing so."

      On the technical side, it's important to ensure our databases are updated regularly to ensure search results remain relevant not just by content but by time, that we have clear flags for emerging information that may change later by context or time, and that time stamps are clear and accurate. The [COVID-19 Expert Database team](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/) work regularly to ensure everything is up to date, circling back on key topics as the science evolves.

      ### __Embrace ambiguity. It's what we've got.__

      Medical doctors have a lot of perspective to offer during times of ambiguous and confusing situations. Many of us have personally received word from a doctor about a health condition that our doctor is still learning about, from a broken bone to cancer. Doctors have perfected the art of expressing uncertainty in a time when people seek certainty. Most cancer diagnoses come with caveats, qualifications and "we simply don't know."

      Saying "I dont' know," as medical journalist Seema Yasmin regularly points out, is an important way for doctors to build trust. Somewhere between information nihilism and a blanket trust in unverified facts comes the harsh reality: we as a society have to accept and live with ambiguity for a significant amount of time. "We don't know yet, but check back in," is a tough pill to swallow, but it's the closest thing we have to truth right now for a lot of aspects of this disease, and it opens up audiences for an invitation to keeping checking in as we learn more.

    body: "A few weeks ago, in a WhatsApp message group with family members, a forwarded
      message showed up on my screen that read: “The COVID-19 plot thickens, please
      do read.” \n \nIn India, where my family is from, it is typical for a day to
      begin with five or more messages in different family or work WhatsApp groups.
      The messages range from friendly updates and innocent gifs to threads pressuring
      you to forward messages to nine people in order to avoid ill-fated planetary
      alignments.\n \nWhat followed the COVID-19 message a few weeks ago was an elaborate
      thread containing false claims about COVID-19 as a lab-made virus, intended
      to boost the sales of Remdesivir and benefit Bill Gates and George Soros. The
      forwarded text falsely claimed that the entire COVID-19 crisis is a well-orchestrated
      effort at the highest levels by Gates, Soros, Obama, and Clinton to develop
      a COVID-19 vaccine, with “the ultimate motivation of making billions of dollars
      in profits at the cost of only losing a mere million human lives.” This particular
      conspiracy theory was disseminated on Facebook in the United States, and quickly
      spread through WhatsApp in India as well.\n \nIn the United States, journalists
      are battling misinformation on open or partially open social platforms like
      Facebook and Twitter. In India, as in other parts of the world, the problem
      may be trickier to catch—and harder to prevent, because misinformation spreads
      predominantly in closed chat groups on WhatsApp, away from the sights of content
      moderators and fact-checkers.  Blatant misinformation campaigns like the one
      I received recently are dangerous under normal circumstances, and downright
      deadly in the midst of a pandemic. Misinformation makes it harder for healthcare
      authorities to effectively communicate critical health information to wider
      audiences.\n \nWhatsApp misinformation in India sows distrust in healthcare
      institutions and encourages disregard for basic public health advice. Often
      disguised as medical advice, doctored videos of a prominent Indian doctor advising
      viewers not to get tested for coronavirus were circulated over 5,000 times on
      Facebook and Twitter. False rumors have led to many Indian doctors and frontline
      healthcare workers being evicted from their homes. This is especially important
      in the Indian context, where unfiltered and inaccurate information spreads rapidly
      on WhatsApp, and can quickly hamper efforts to trace, isolate, and care for
      COVID cases. Healthcare workers attempting to stop the spread of COVID-19 have
      been attacked by mobs across India as recently as April, and misinformation
      has only exacerbated the violence.\n \nIn March 2020, one particular message
      circulating on WhatsApp caught the attention of the Government of India’s Press
      Information Bureau (PIB). The message falsely claimed that the Government was
      spraying “CV vaccine gas inside the country, through airplanes.”\n \nThe official
      Twitter account of PIB (@PIBFactCheck) responded by stating: “Amidst #Coronavirusoutbreak,
      misinformation on CV Vaccine gas spread out through Airplanes is circulating
      on social media. NO such action has been planned out by the Indian Government.
      Get your facts from trusted sources. Do not amplify #fakenews!”\n \nAge-old
      rumors about vaccine safety are now being tailored to COVID-19 audiences to
      promote vaccine hesitancy, which could derail efforts not only for the eventual
      implementation of a COVID-19 vaccine, but also for the continuation of routine
      vaccinations for myriad other diseases.\n \nThe misinformation amid the pandemic
      is not limited to vaccine hesitancy. In some  parts of India, the indigenous
      cow has been elevated to new heights and questionable treatments, such as cow
      urine, have been marketed as an effective remedy against the novel coronavirus.
      Such claims may have gained legitimacy under the current Government, which created
      an open call for research & development proposals that examine dubious pseudo-scientific
      treatments such as “cowpathy” for “medicine and health” in February this year.
      In such circumstances, it becomes even more difficult to distinguish science
      from pseudoscience in a pandemic, especially as misinformation seems to travel
      even faster than COVID-19 in India.\n \nIn Mizoram, approximately 15 individuals
      were arrested for spreading a fictitious and official-sounding directive from
      state officials, asking local citizens from outside Mizoram to return home at
      once. Similar arrests have taken place in Rajasthan, Odisha, and other Indian
      states. Successive state governments have responded to misinformation by conducting
      mass arrests rather than tackling the problem at its root by improving health
      communication in localized languages.\n \nEffective health communication in
      a pandemic requires systematic investments in health infrastructure and adequate
      training for academics and journalists. Fortunately, many organizations are
      meeting this gap and providing resources and responses to tackle such misinformation.
      Organizations such as SciLine, the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN),
      and COVID Explained have developed several resources, unpacking claims about
      COVID-19. While many such projects focus on general misinformation related to
      COVID-19, there is an increased need for addressing vaccine misinformation specifically,
      and to provide the context needed for individuals that speak a variety of different
      languages, with varying health literacy levels.\n  \nThere is a paucity of evidence-based
      information for journalists, fact-checkers and everyday WhatsApp users to effectively
      unpack disingenuous claims, whether it be anti-vaccine propaganda or the marketing
      of natural and herbal remedies as cures for the coronavirus.\n \nIndia has detected
      1.2 million cases and 30,000 deaths of COVID-19, according to the Ministry of
      Health & Family Welfare. Given the difficulties around active surveillance in
      India, experts believe the actual number could be even higher. Even if official
      estimates are to be believed, however, the contagion of misinformation threatens
      to derail existing efforts and present roadblocks to the development of a future
      vaccine.\n \nIt is now more imperative than ever before to prioritize effective
      health communication in order to tackle the scourge of misinformation, especially
      as we double down on efforts to rein in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n \n*Mohit Nair

    body: "The proliferation of misinformation and disinformation online throughout
      the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly yielded a corresponding ‘infodemic.’ Information
      around the novel coronavirus is shifting daily and narratives vary based on
      the contexts in which we live, work and socialize.  \n\nThis creates a near-perfect
      recipe for a confusing, substandard information ecosystem and intentionally
      false information. Mis- and disinformation related to the pandemic is not just
      \ harmful for individuals, but, because of the nature of the virus, low-quality
      information also adversely impacts the collective and directly contributes to
      greater numbers of cases and deaths. \n\nAs both a graduate student pursuing
      an MPH at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and as a young person
      raised in the American South, I’ve had a lens into two contrasting sides of
      the COVID-19 online informational arena. On the one hand, I have access to some
      of the highest-quality and timely information on the pandemic. On the other,
      I have a lens into American skepticism of the CDC and WHO, and clear gaps in
      which  public health authorities  (such as from Harvard Chan, the CDC, and WHO
      themselves), are not effectively reaching the general public, particularly in
      the digital realm. \n\nMisinformation is highly challenging to regulate, often
      because it spreads  informally across a range of social media platforms. Evidence
      shows that traditional public health interventions on social media, which present
      text-heavy facts on platforms, are inadequate for obtaining wide-reach. This
      becomes particularly clear when those interventions are compared to the reach
      of mis- and disinformation. Exacerbating this challenge is the fact that news
      sources are often not staffed with in-house public health experts, and given
      that, there are significant bottlenecks within academia that preclude a free-flowing
      stream of the most up-to-date health information for journalists.\n\nIn order
      to address this set of challenges, student group Students Against COVID-19 (SAC)
      and [Meedan's COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/) are
      partnering to pair the latest expert health information with digestible infographics
      tailored to online spaces and resharing. Through the partnership, SAC will leverage
      the Meedan Digital Health Lab’s team of experts to translate their most recent
      COVID-19 updates and answers to pressing questions into highly accessible visuals
      particularly intended for online audiences globally. Graphics will be posted
      alongside expert answers on the [learnaboutcovid19.org](http://learnaboutcovid19.org/)
      database for easy viewing and sharing. This pairing of content and visuals has
      the potential for broad impact in mitigating health misinformation online and,
      in turn, improved public health outcomes. \n\n![Zoonotic Diseases](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3hzT12rbPNOOF4inKiGxzp/763ba6cb8a26539ddcd96eebb4e9adaa/Screen_Shot_2020-06-26_at_2.56.45_PM.png)!

      online, and 2) protect our school community and communities of residence during
      this crisis. COVID-19 is testing our nation’s fabric and in this time of crisis
      and misinformation, students have a crucial role to play as ambassadors of facts
      and quality information. The focus is to lead national social media and information
      campaigns that push evidence-based information on COVID-19 to the general public
      and empower online users to do the same. Learn more at [studentsagainstcovid-19.com](https://www.studentsagainstcovid-19.com/)
