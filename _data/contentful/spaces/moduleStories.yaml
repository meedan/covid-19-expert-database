    body: "Breastfeeding promotes early childhood cognitive development, prevents
      young child infections including pneumonia and diarrhea, and improves mental
      and physical health in mothers. That’s why each year during the first week of
      August, [World Breastfeeding Week](https://worldbreastfeedingweek.org) is celebrated
      to raise awareness and promote breastfeeding as the best source of nutrition
      for most babies. \n\nGeneral breastfeeding guidance from the World Health Organization
      (WHO) and other leading health authorities includes breastfeeding for the first
      six months of life all the way to two years of age and beyond.\n\nUnfortunately,
      misinformation about breastfeeding is widespread. Claims often center around:\n\n-
      Foods breastfeeding mothers should or should not eat (In general, [breastfeeding
      moms](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/diet-and-micronutrients/maternal-diet.html)
      should eat a varied diet and don’t need to include or avoid specific foods except
      for some seafood that may be high in mercury.)\n\n- If exercise changes the
      taste of breastmilk ([Exercise](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      is healthy and has not been shown to change the taste of breastmilk.)\n\n- Whether
      negative emotions affect breastmilk quality (Breastmilk quality [doesn’t change](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding)
      based on mom’s emotions.)\n\n- Whether it is okay for a mother to breastfeed
      if she is ill ([In most cases](https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/14-myths-about-breastfeeding),
      moms should continue to breastfeed even when they’re ill because breastmilk
      passes on immune defense to the baby, but there are some exceptions so always
      check with your or your baby’s doctor.)\n \nExacerbating the issue, early in
      the coronavirus pandemic incomplete scientific consensus and confusion resulted
      in brand new types of breastfeeding [misinformation](https://www.iol.co.za/lifestyle/family/baby/covid-19-moms-and-breastfeeding-separating-facts-from-fiction-add70b6c-9821-4471-8297-67e69947c5b1).
      Because little was known about the virus, many feared that the virus would spread
      from mothers to their infants through [breastmilk](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      and those concerns were shared widely in online communities. \n\nOffline challenges
      of COVID-19 have also taken hold. Lockdown limits access to pre- and postnatal
      lactation support [services](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
      leaving mothers vulnerable to online or familial misinformation in the absence
      of professional breastfeeding support. Some women have been [advised](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036629/)
      by doctors not to breastfeed or to stop breastfeeding. \n\nIn some cases, babies
      [were](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30327-2/fulltext)
      separated from mothers in hospitals, a practice known to make establishing breastfeeding
      [difficult](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html),
      decrease breastfeeding [success](https://trends.hms.harvard.edu/2020/03/31/covid-19-separating-infected-mothers-from-newborns-weighing-the-risks-and-benefits/),
      inhibit [early bonding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27885658/) and attachment,
      and [negatively impact maternal mental health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842365/).
      Finally, some reports have also suggested that formula companies began further
      undermining breastfeeding messages by promoting formula as safer than breastmilk
      during the pandemic.\n \nNow, eight months into the pandemic, we have improved
      understanding and data, so breastfeeding recommendations for mothers infected
      with COVID-19 are clearer. Despite misinformation, while studies of breastmilk
      and breastfeeding are ongoing, current research shows that the risk of an infant
      becoming infected with COVID-19 through breast milk is low. \nThe WHO [suggests](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/breastfeeding-and-covid-19)
      that “at this point, it appears that COVID-19 in infants and children represents
      a much lower threat to survival and health than other infections that breastfeeding
      is protective against.” Meanwhile the threat of poor health outcomes as a result
      of not breastfeeding is [particularly true](https://www.bfmed.org/assets/DOCUMENTS/abm-position-breastfeeding.pdf)
      in areas where access to clean water and medical care are limited.\n \nFor those
      on the front lines who are supporting moms and babies everyday, providing encouragement,
      addressing misinformation, and empowering mothers to make well-informed feeding
      decisions, are a huge part of providing high-quality care. While babies are
      not immune from contracting COVID-19, based on the current evidence the WHO
      advises that even with suspected or confirmed maternal COVID-19, breastfeeding
      is recommended for infants and young children. The U.S. Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention further advise mothers to further discuss breastfeeding
      with their healthcare providers.\n \nResources:\n[World Alliance for Breastfeeding.

    body: "During the Black Plague, before scientists could catch up and diagnose
      the actual cause of the disease (a bacterium called Yersinia pestis), [religious
      cures, potions and bloodletting](https://www.ancient.eu/article/1540/medieval-cures-for-the-black-death/)
      filled anxiety-inducing gaps in information that incomplete infectious disease
      research could not yet speak to. Years later, before the true biology of the
      Spanish Flu was discovered, even[ many scientists](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2118275/)
      believed wrongly that the flu came from the same bacterium that caused diseases
      like anthrax, cholera, and plague. Today we see similar misinformation surrounding
      COVID-19 treatments, cures and preventions, all spreading across the internet
      before they’ve been verified or refuted by good science. \n\nIn all of these
      cases, the need or desire to know a truth outpaces the discovery of that truth
      *(\"How much should we be testing? How did the virus spread? What are the symptoms?
      What are the cures?\")*. So people make stuff up. They latch onto theories,
      maybe because bad information and hasty news is more comforting than no information
      at all. Earlier this week, An Xiao Mina [coined this concept](https://meedan.com/blog/missing-information-not-just-misinformation-is-part-of-the-problem/)
      “midinformation.\" \n\nToday’s online environment exacerbates the spread of
      all forms of misleading content, by amplifying false or understudied theories
      that lead to poor health outcomes worldwide. The internet's democratization
      of knowledge and ensuing decentralization of information authority triggers
      much of this exacerbation. It also calls for solutions that are as powerful
      and scaleable as the problem itself. \n\nThere is a growing global need for
      a workforce that can help the public root through the noise of the internet
      and get to the bottom of the chaos. More than just a baseline need for journalism
      and high quality reporting (which is equally critical, and proactive), the myriad
      failures of governments, platforms and information leaders during COVID-19,
      and a general and growing skepticism of science call for more of us to be able
      to spot midinformation and misinformation, discern its different manifestations,
      debunk the claims online and spread the message. We are hoping to address these
      challenges through a new vertical at Meedan that trains university students
      to spot and verify misleading information. \n\nThis is important now more than
      ever. Waning public trust in authorities, coupled with an evolving disease in
      which research and science changes daily, is predictably sowing confusion, and
      opening gaps for bad actors to manipulate online narratives. We’re seeing this
      virtually everywhere. Brazil and the United States are already well documented,
      but in the Philippines, top leaders spread misinformation about how to properly
      wear masks in public; in India, health misinformation is intertwined with existing
      divided narratives between Hindus and Muslims and people are confused by false
      information about ayurvedic “cures”; countries that are predominantly Arabic-speaking
      lack access to critical health information in their native language from leading
      global health organizations; in Tribal regions in the United States and Canada,
      government guidelines are widely out of touch with the reality of indigenous,
      community-centered living.\n\nThe gaps are slightly different in every region,
      but the trend is consistent across language, demographics and other divides:
      people are in need of high quality health information, not just because of the
      general and obvious importance of being able to discern what’s true from what’s
      false, but because knowing things about health leads to doing things about health.
      Literally. Knowing the ground truth about vaccine safety [can lead to](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X1500506X)
      getting vaccinated. Knowing how to wear a mask can lead to wearing a mask right.
      If your information is wrong, unrealistic, misleading, or inaccessible because
      of language or literacy, then the things you’ll do with that information (or
      lack thereof it) will be incorrect and unsafe. Conspiracy theories about vaccination
      lead people I know not only to not vaccinate, but to also spread those conspiracy
      theories so that others don’t vaccinate either.\n\nThrough [Credibility Coalition](https://credibilitycoalition.org/credcatalog/),
      our joint program with Hacks/Hackers, we’re launching a Google News Initiative-supported
      series of Fall 2020 training programs in which students from Germany, Yemen,
      Syria, Cairo, the United States and other places learn critical debunking skills
      amid a century-defining pandemic. All together, we’ll be training more than
      1,100 students from 14 schools. To this end, we’re doing the following:\n\n-
      Developing a syllabus with Syracuse Univeristy’s Jennifer Grygiel \n\n- Walking
      students through sourcing, screening, categorizing and debunking claims\n\n-
      Using Check, Meedan’s online verification tool, as a collaborative education
      platform on which to train and evaluate students \n\nThis is just the beginning
      of our efforts to educate professionals and students about responsible ways
      to debunk claims related to topics as critical as our own health and well-being.
      It builds off many years of Meedan experience in this realm, from our initial
      collaboration with the University of Hong Kong’s Cyber Verification Lab to UC
      Berkeley’s Human Rights Center to our ONA Challenge Grant project with the University
      of Nevada Reno’s Reynolds School of Journalism. These lessons have taught us
      that the act of fact-checking and verification is one of the best tools for
      learning about these processes, and we’re excited to formalize this at a new
      level."

      As the world slowly starts to open up (or not), we've entered a new pandemic stage: confusion. Where once the most solid advice was simply to stay indoors and avoid others, we seem to be encountering a panoply of recommendations. Wash your hands. Masks aren't needed. Wear a mask. Stay six feet away. Actually, it might be airborne, so stay outside too. Take a test. Don't take a test, because supplies are limited.

      In the world of public health, this liminal stage we find ourselves in --- moving past lockdown but nowhere near reaching either a social or medical endpoint to the pandemic --- is often the most dangerous for a disease's spread. In 1918, the city of San Francisco had the fewest reported cases of Spanish Flu in the country thanks to strict social distancing practices. The city and the people declared victory, emerged from lockdown, and returned to normal life. By the end of the year, the city had one of the worst infection and mortality rates in the US, [with 45,000 cases and more than 3,000 deaths](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/san-francisco-had-1918-flu-under-control-then-it-lifted-n1191141).

      In the world of information trust, this liminal stage presents another threat: epistemic ambiguity. The usual model for misleading information is two fold: there's misinformation --- false information spread unintentionally --- and disinformation --- false information spread with the intent of harm. We've certainly seen this with COVID-19. [Misinfodemics](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/how-misinfodemics-spread-disease/568921/), the spread of false information that exacerbates the spread of disease, have erupted around [drinking bleach](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/06/americans-are-drinking-bleach-and-dunking-food-in-it-to-prevent-covid-19/) or [methanol](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/iran-700-dead-drinking-alcohol-cure-coronavirus-200427163529629.html), having immunity [based on race](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-14/no-black-people-aren-t-immune-to-covid-19), and countless other bits of misinformation, leading to hospitalizations and even deaths.

      From a fact-checking perspective, this is relatively straightforward. Health professionals *know* bleach and methanol don't cure COVID-19. But the problem is in the murky areas, when fact-checking is being done in good faith but the extant body of knowledge is limited and evolving.

      Take an example from this summer. In June, an official from the World Health Organization COVID-19 [caused significant public confusion](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2020/who-comments-on-asymptomatic-covid-19-transmission-is-lesson-in-research-and-context/) by saying that asymptomatic spread of novel coronavirus is rare. [As Poynter's Al Tompkins wrote](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2020/who-comments-on-asymptomatic-covid-19-transmission-is-lesson-in-research-and-context/), this statement could "light new fires among people who believe the entire COVID-19 pandemic has been overblown and that there was no need for stay-at-home orders that keep seemingly healthy people at home." The next day, the WHO issued a clarification: the researcher was referring to emergent data from a small set of studies.

      So much more is being learned about the virus. We don't know right now if [people can be reinfected or not](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/can-someone-get-reinfected-and-get-covid-19-a-second-time/#undefined). Experts are debating whether [there's airborne transmission](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02058-1). We're still learning about [the role of vitamins](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/questions/does-vitamin-d-help-prevent-or-treat-covid-19/). And it's not just that we don't know --- it's that no one knows. Science hasn't caught up yet. Do we wear a mask or not wear a mask? It's obvious now that we should, but just a few months ago, even respected bodies like the WHO and CDC were [offering conflicting advice](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/cdc-offer-conflicting-advice-masks-expert-tells-us/story?id=70958380).

      It turns out that the framework of mis- and disinformation has a basic assumption that doesn't always apply in the case of COVID-19: the idea that there might be a ground truth, somewhere, at some point, that someone might have in some situation. [As I've written before](https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/12/the-death-of-consensus-not-the-death-of-truth/), the process of consensus-making requires a negotiation of truth through trusted parties and sources (and therefore subject to the rules of trust, emotion and relatability).

      But what if the information we're trying to discuss isn't known by anyone?


      ## Midinformation: When knowledge stands in the middle, what do we do?

      In the case of emerging knowledge, it might be helpful to think not just about misinformation but *mid*information. We know a little now, we'll know more later, and we may never know everything ever. In other words, information stands in the middle, and we're trying. Scientists are gaining some clarity, but it's going to take some time for scientific consensus to build, and for public understanding to catch up.

      Midinformation, in other words, is the sort of information crisis that happens when not all the facts are known. In that vacuum of knowledge, all kinds of rumors, conspiracies, misunderstandings and misconceptions can emerge, because it's comforting to have an anchor that feels true and reliable.

      **We might define midinformation as informational ambiguity based on scant or conflicting evidence, often about emerging scientific knowledge.** And the COVID-19 pandemic is rife with it. The usual media literacy course teaches basic things: vet your sources, look for corroborating evidence, [read laterally](https://webliteracy.pressbooks.com/chapter/what-reading-laterally-means/). But the phenomenon of midinformation requires new skills, for journalists, educators and all of us.

      Here are some:

      ### __Take a breather.__

      This one's obvious, but in an attention economy, it's harder and harder to resist checking the news. Doomscrolling, as [WIRED writer Angela Watercutter](https://www.wired.com/story/stop-doomscrolling/) has pointed out, makes us *feel* better prepared for what's going on, but it might actually be hurting us.

      > Right now, people are living at a time with no easy solutions, a moment with a lot of conflicting "facts" in a rapidly changing landscape. According to Nicole Ellison, who studies communication and social media at the University of Michigan's School of Information, that means there's a "lot of demand on cognitive processing to make sense of this. There's no overarching narrative that helps us." That, she adds, only compounds the stress and anxiety they're already feeling.

      Watercutter points out that COVID-19 isn't a sprint; it's a marathon. We have to take care of our mental health, recognize when our attention to the news might be destructive, and to remember that resolution to the pandemic will take time, at the scale of years, not months or weeks. To curb my own doomscrolling habit, I've been reading books and putting my phone away before going to bed.

      ### __We're doing science in public --- help people understand that.__

      The experience of the WHO researcher reflects a reality for every public health researcher: there's often no data, and when there is data, it's not validated or vetted, and it might even be in conflict with other studies. The scientific method demands replicability of results, but this process can take months, if not years, far slower than a typical news cycle and certainly much slower than the lightning speed of viral media. "We're six months into a pandemic," she said in her public clarification. "There's a huge amount of research that is being done, but we don't have that full picture yet."

      <p class="caption">Book Talk and Webinar: Keep Calm and Log On with author Gus Andrews</p>

      In a recent conversation I had [with author Gus Andrews](https://www.keepcalmlogon.com/about-author-gillian-gus-andrews), I asked her about how we deal this. Because of significant scientific advances in the fields of physics, chemistry and astronomy, we're used to the idea of scientific consensus on key topics.

      But this is a novel coronavirus, and we're doing science in public now, she said. That means heated debates, scant data, papers that haven't been subject to peer review, and all kinds of conversations usually limited to experts but now exposed to the public by the pandemic given the enormous interest in the topic. It's vital that we help each other along in understanding what a lack of scientific consensus looks like, and [how to navigate the waters of an infodemic](https://www.yalemedicine.org/stories/covid-19-infodemic/).

      And remember to focus on what we do know: stay at home as much as possible, wear a mask if you go out, etc. It's important that we not let the inevitable confusion that arises from midinformation to in turn foster information nihilism.

      ### __Bring audiences along on the journey.__

      Here's what Gus had to say: "I wonder if we can give more people the feeling that they're part of the evolving discussion by encouraging them to keep listening and educating themselves on the latest narratives. Which maybe even unfolds like a podcast or other series, where there's value and a feeling of safety in becoming part of the community that keeps engaging. We're all learning, together, and we become stronger by doing so."

      On the technical side, it's important to ensure our databases are updated regularly to ensure search results remain relevant not just by content but by time, that we have clear flags for emerging information that may change later by context or time, and that time stamps are clear and accurate.

      ### __Embrace ambiguity. It's what we've got.__

      Medical doctors have a lot of perspective to offer during times of ambiguous and confusing situations. Many of us have personally received word from a doctor about a health condition that our doctor is still learning about, from a broken bone to cancer. Doctors have perfected the art of expressing uncertainty in a time when people seek certainty. Most cancer diagnoses come with caveats, qualifications and "we simply don't know."

      Saying "I dont' know," as medical journalist Seema Yasmin regularly points out, is an important way for doctors to build trust. Somewhere between information nihilism and a blanket trust in unverified facts comes the harsh reality: we as a society have to accept and live with ambiguity for a significant amount of time. "We don't know yet, but check back in," is a tough pill to swallow, but it's the closest thing we have to truth right now for a lot of aspects of this disease, and it opens up audiences for an invitation to keeping checking in as we learn more.

    body: "Last week I was fortunate to receive corrective surgery on my disabled
      arm, a remnant of an injury from over 9 months ago. When the COVID-19 pandemic
      hit, changing all of our plans, it understandably delayed non-essential medical
      procedures like the one I needed.\n \nJuly 2020 marks [30 years since the passage
      of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/30th_anniversary/index.html).
      Twelve years ago the [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
      (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html)
      came into effect, which was the first United Nations (UN) human rights treaty
      of the 21st century, and also the UN convention with the largest number of signatories
      in history on its opening day.  \n\nAs I recover, I am reflecting on what these
      mean for my friends and colleagues with disabilities, including disabilities
      that are permanent or longer-term than my own. \n\nWe have made progress through
      high-level decisions and cultural shifts. For example, plans for people with
      disabilities are now included in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, the
      Paris Agreement on Global Climate Change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster
      Risk Reduction, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development.
      Yet there is much more to do  – we still have not achieved universal access,
      and people with disabilities are being disproportionately affected by the COVID-19
      pandemic in multiple ways.\n\n- People with disabilities are at a higher risk
      of severe symptoms and death from COVID-19. A [study published in the *Disability
      and Health Journal*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245650/)
      found that there is a higher COVID-19 fatality rate among people with intellectual
      and developmental disabilities (IDD). The researchers also found a higher concentration
      of COVID-19 cases at younger ages for people with IDD. Last month, the American
      Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) shared [devastating statistics](https://www.aclu.org/news/disability-rights/covid-19-deaths-in-nursing-homes-are-not-unavoidable-they-are-the-result-of-deadly-discrimination/)
      on the anniversary of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v.
      L.C., which recognized that unjustified segregation of people with disabilities
      is a form of discrimination: Nearly 50% of COVID-19 deaths have been among people
      living in nursing homes, psychiatric hospitals, and other congregate settings
      for people with disabilities, while this population only makes up less than
      1% of the U.S. population. The ACLU warns us that these excess and inequitable
      deaths are “not unavoidable – they are the result of deadly discrimination.”\n\n-
      People with disabilities are also excluded as much of our world moves online
      during the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting everything from education and employment
      to essential services and social connection. There is [growing worldwide concern](https://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=2322)
      about the digital divide, where many people still lack access to technologies
      like computers and smartphones, not to mention affordable as well as reliable
      internet and even electricity. The most affected tend to be [lower-income](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/07/digital-divide-persists-even-as-lower-income-americans-make-gains-in-tech-adoption/),
      [older generations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/technology/virus-older-generation-digital-divide.html),
      [racial and ethnic minorities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/20/smartphones-help-blacks-hispanics-bridge-some-but-not-all-digital-gaps-with-whites/),
      [sexual and gender minorities](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/GenderDigital/HRBDT_submission.pdf),
      and [people with disabilities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/07/disabled-americans-are-less-likely-to-use-technology/),
      with many intersectionalities. Exacerbating this, people with disabilities can
      face additional barriers, such as:\n\n\n1.   Increased risks of online harassment
      and discrimination\n\n2.   Lack of adaptations for limited abilities to see,
      hear, and understand content\n\n3.  Lack of adaptations for limited physical
      abilities to use devices (ex.    following my injury, I learned to type using
      one hand supplemented with voice recognition software)\n\nIt is more crucial
      than ever to mitigate barriers like these during a pandemic, where online access
      to quality information and essential activities can directly influence health
      outcomes.\n\nHere at Meedan, the Digital Health Lab is working to address “viral
      misinformation that facilitates the spread of a particular health outcome or
      disease,” also called a “misinfodemic,” by increasing access to expert-sourced
      information about COVID-19. \n\nMeedan’s efforts to increase access include
      avoiding jargon to make information readable by the general public, providing
      a glossary with simplified definitions of scientific terms, translating information
      for non-English speakers, and disseminating information across diverse media
      channels. In this process, we cannot forget to include people with disabilities.
      Leaving out people with disabilities means hurting a significant proportion
      of humanity: The World Health Organization (WHO) [estimates that over 1 billion](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health)
      people experience some form of disability. Additionally, the ADA and CRPD require
      making online content, services, and systems accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nEquality
      under the law does not automatically translate to equity in everyday practice.
      We have to do the hard work of building the inclusive world we’d like to see,
      and we need to continuously work on addressing ableism and centering disability
      justice. Meedan’s Digital Health Lab is striving to increase access to COVID-19
      information for all, including people with disabilities, and we invite you to
      join us.\n\nResources:\n\n[ADA Best Practices Chapter 5 Website Accessibility](https://www.ada.gov/pcatoolkit/chap5toolkit.htm)\n[Federal

    body: "A few weeks ago, in a WhatsApp message group with family members, a forwarded
      message showed up on my screen that read: “The COVID-19 plot thickens, please
      do read.” \n \nIn India, where my family is from, it is typical for a day to
      begin with five or more messages in different family or work WhatsApp groups.
      The messages range from friendly updates and innocent gifs to threads pressuring
      you to forward messages to nine people in order to avoid ill-fated planetary
      alignments.\n \nWhat followed the COVID-19 message a few weeks ago was an elaborate
      thread containing false claims about COVID-19 as a lab-made virus, intended
      to boost the sales of Remdesivir and benefit Bill Gates and George Soros. The
      forwarded text falsely claimed that the entire COVID-19 crisis is a well-orchestrated
      effort at the highest levels by Gates, Soros, Obama, and Clinton to develop
      a COVID-19 vaccine, with “the ultimate motivation of making billions of dollars
      in profits at the cost of only losing a mere million human lives.” This particular
      conspiracy theory was disseminated on Facebook in the United States, and quickly
      spread through WhatsApp in India as well.\n \nIn the United States, journalists
      are battling misinformation on open or partially open social platforms like
      Facebook and Twitter. In India, as in other parts of the world, the problem
      may be trickier to catch—and harder to prevent, because misinformation spreads
      predominantly in closed chat groups on WhatsApp, away from the sights of content
      moderators and fact-checkers.  Blatant misinformation campaigns like the one
      I received recently are dangerous under normal circumstances, and downright
      deadly in the midst of a pandemic. Misinformation makes it harder for healthcare
      authorities to effectively communicate critical health information to wider
      audiences.\n \nWhatsApp misinformation in India sows distrust in healthcare
      institutions and encourages disregard for basic public health advice. Often
      disguised as medical advice, doctored videos of a prominent Indian doctor advising
      viewers not to get tested for coronavirus were circulated over 5,000 times on
      Facebook and Twitter. False rumors have led to many Indian doctors and frontline
      healthcare workers being evicted from their homes. This is especially important
      in the Indian context, where unfiltered and inaccurate information spreads rapidly
      on WhatsApp, and can quickly hamper efforts to trace, isolate, and care for
      COVID cases. Healthcare workers attempting to stop the spread of COVID-19 have
      been attacked by mobs across India as recently as April, and misinformation
      has only exacerbated the violence.\n \nIn March 2020, one particular message
      circulating on WhatsApp caught the attention of the Government of India’s Press
      Information Bureau (PIB). The message falsely claimed that the Government was
      spraying “CV vaccine gas inside the country, through airplanes.”\n \nThe official
      Twitter account of PIB (@PIBFactCheck) responded by stating: “Amidst #Coronavirusoutbreak,
      misinformation on CV Vaccine gas spread out through Airplanes is circulating
      on social media. NO such action has been planned out by the Indian Government.
      Get your facts from trusted sources. Do not amplify #fakenews!”\n \nAge-old
      rumors about vaccine safety are now being tailored to COVID-19 audiences to
      promote vaccine hesitancy, which could derail efforts not only for the eventual
      implementation of a COVID-19 vaccine, but also for the continuation of routine
      vaccinations for myriad other diseases.\n \nThe misinformation amid the pandemic
      is not limited to vaccine hesitancy. In some  parts of India, the indigenous
      cow has been elevated to new heights and questionable treatments, such as cow
      urine, have been marketed as an effective remedy against the novel coronavirus.
      Such claims may have gained legitimacy under the current Government, which created
      an open call for research & development proposals that examine dubious pseudo-scientific
      treatments such as “cowpathy” for “medicine and health” in February this year.
      In such circumstances, it becomes even more difficult to distinguish science
      from pseudoscience in a pandemic, especially as misinformation seems to travel
      even faster than COVID-19 in India.\n \nIn Mizoram, approximately 15 individuals
      were arrested for spreading a fictitious and official-sounding directive from
      state officials, asking local citizens from outside Mizoram to return home at
      once. Similar arrests have taken place in Rajasthan, Odisha, and other Indian
      states. Successive state governments have responded to misinformation by conducting
      mass arrests rather than tackling the problem at its root by improving health
      communication in localized languages.\n \nEffective health communication in
      a pandemic requires systematic investments in health infrastructure and adequate
      training for academics and journalists. Fortunately, many organizations are
      meeting this gap and providing resources and responses to tackle such misinformation.
      Organizations such as SciLine, the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN),
      and COVID Explained have developed several resources, unpacking claims about
      COVID-19. While many such projects focus on general misinformation related to
      COVID-19, there is an increased need for addressing vaccine misinformation specifically,
      and to provide the context needed for individuals that speak a variety of different
      languages, with varying health literacy levels.\n  \nThere is a paucity of evidence-based
      information for journalists, fact-checkers and everyday WhatsApp users to effectively
      unpack disingenuous claims, whether it be anti-vaccine propaganda or the marketing
      of natural and herbal remedies as cures for the coronavirus.\n \nIndia has detected
      1.2 million cases and 30,000 deaths of COVID-19, according to the Ministry of
      Health & Family Welfare. Given the difficulties around active surveillance in
      India, experts believe the actual number could be even higher. Even if official
      estimates are to be believed, however, the contagion of misinformation threatens
      to derail existing efforts and present roadblocks to the development of a future
      vaccine.\n \nIt is now more imperative than ever before to prioritize effective
      health communication in order to tackle the scourge of misinformation, especially
      as we double down on efforts to rein in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n \n*Mohit Nair

      \ harmful for individuals, but, because of the nature of the virus, low-quality
      information also adversely impacts the collective and directly contributes to
      greater numbers of cases and deaths. \n\nAs both a graduate student pursuing
      an MPH at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and as a young person
      raised in the American South, I’ve had a lens into two contrasting sides of
      the COVID-19 online informational arena. On the one hand, I have access to some
      of the highest-quality and timely information on the pandemic. On the other,
      I have a lens into American skepticism of the CDC and WHO, and clear gaps in
      which  public health authorities  (such as from Harvard Chan, the CDC, and WHO
      themselves), are not effectively reaching the general public, particularly in
      the digital realm. \n\nMisinformation is highly challenging to regulate, often
      because it spreads  informally across a range of social media platforms. Evidence
      shows that traditional public health interventions on social media, which present
      text-heavy facts on platforms, are inadequate for obtaining wide-reach. This
      becomes particularly clear when those interventions are compared to the reach
      of mis- and disinformation. Exacerbating this challenge is the fact that news
      sources are often not staffed with in-house public health experts, and given
      that, there are significant bottlenecks within academia that preclude a free-flowing
      stream of the most up-to-date health information for journalists.\n\nIn order
      to address this set of challenges, student group Students Against COVID-19 (SAC)
      and [Meedan's COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/) are
      partnering to pair the latest expert health information with digestible infographics
      tailored to online spaces and resharing. Through the partnership, SAC will leverage
      the Meedan Digital Health Lab’s team of experts to translate their most recent
      COVID-19 updates and answers to pressing questions into highly accessible visuals
      particularly intended for online audiences globally. Graphics will be posted
      alongside expert answers on the [learnaboutcovid19.org](http://learnaboutcovid19.org/)
      database for easy viewing and sharing. This pairing of content and visuals has
      the potential for broad impact in mitigating health misinformation online and,
      in turn, improved public health outcomes. \n\n![Zoonotic Diseases](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3hzT12rbPNOOF4inKiGxzp/763ba6cb8a26539ddcd96eebb4e9adaa/Screen_Shot_2020-06-26_at_2.56.45_PM.png)!
