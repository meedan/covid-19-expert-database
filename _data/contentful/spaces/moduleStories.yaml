    body: "A few weeks ago, in a WhatsApp message group with family members, a forwarded
      message showed up on my screen that read: “The COVID-19 plot thickens, please
      do read.” \n \nIn India, where my family is from, it is typical for a day to
      begin with five or more messages in different family or work WhatsApp groups.
      The messages range from friendly updates and innocent gifs to threads pressuring
      you to forward messages to nine people in order to avoid ill-fated planetary
      alignments.\n \nWhat followed the COVID-19 message a few weeks ago was an elaborate
      thread containing false claims about COVID-19 as a lab-made virus, intended
      to boost the sales of Remdesivir and benefit Bill Gates and George Soros. The
      forwarded text falsely claimed that the entire COVID-19 crisis is a well-orchestrated
      effort at the highest levels by Gates, Soros, Obama, and Clinton to develop
      a COVID-19 vaccine, with “the ultimate motivation of making billions of dollars
      in profits at the cost of only losing a mere million human lives.” This particular
      conspiracy theory was disseminated on Facebook in the United States, and quickly
      spread through WhatsApp in India as well.\n \nIn the United States, journalists
      are battling misinformation on open or partially open social platforms like
      Facebook and Twitter. In India, as in other parts of the world, the problem
      may be trickier to catch—and harder to prevent, because misinformation spreads
      predominantly in closed chat groups on WhatsApp, away from the sights of content
      moderators and fact-checkers.  Blatant misinformation campaigns like the one
      I received recently are dangerous under normal circumstances, and downright
      deadly in the midst of a pandemic. Misinformation makes it harder for healthcare
      authorities to effectively communicate critical health information to wider
      audiences.\n \nWhatsApp misinformation in India sows distrust in healthcare
      institutions and encourages disregard for basic public health advice. Often
      disguised as medical advice, doctored videos of a prominent Indian doctor advising
      viewers not to get tested for coronavirus were circulated over 5,000 times on
      Facebook and Twitter. False rumors have led to many Indian doctors and frontline
      healthcare workers being evicted from their homes. This is especially important
      in the Indian context, where unfiltered and inaccurate information spreads rapidly
      on WhatsApp, and can quickly hamper efforts to trace, isolate, and care for
      COVID cases. Healthcare workers attempting to stop the spread of COVID-19 have
      been attacked by mobs across India as recently as April, and misinformation
      has only exacerbated the violence.\n \nIn March 2020, one particular message
      circulating on WhatsApp caught the attention of the Government of India’s Press
      Information Bureau (PIB). The message falsely claimed that the Government was
      spraying “CV vaccine gas inside the country, through airplanes.”\n \nThe official
      Twitter account of PIB (@PIBFactCheck) responded by stating: “Amidst #Coronavirusoutbreak,
      misinformation on CV Vaccine gas spread out through Airplanes is circulating
      on social media. NO such action has been planned out by the Indian Government.
      Get your facts from trusted sources. Do not amplify #fakenews!”\n \nAge-old
      rumors about vaccine safety are now being tailored to COVID-19 audiences to
      promote vaccine hesitancy, which could derail efforts not only for the eventual
      implementation of a COVID-19 vaccine, but also for the continuation of routine
      vaccinations for myriad other diseases.\n \nThe misinformation amid the pandemic
      is not limited to vaccine hesitancy. In some  parts of India, the indigenous
      cow has been elevated to new heights and questionable treatments, such as cow
      urine, have been marketed as an effective remedy against the novel coronavirus.
      Such claims may have gained legitimacy under the current Government, which created
      an open call for research & development proposals that examine dubious pseudo-scientific
      treatments such as “cowpathy” for “medicine and health” in February this year.
      In such circumstances, it becomes even more difficult to distinguish science
      from pseudoscience in a pandemic, especially as misinformation seems to travel
      even faster than COVID-19 in India.\n \nIn Mizoram, approximately 15 individuals
      were arrested for spreading a fictitious and official-sounding directive from
      state officials, asking local citizens from outside Mizoram to return home at
      once. Similar arrests have taken place in Rajasthan, Odisha, and other Indian
      states. Successive state governments have responded to misinformation by conducting
      mass arrests rather than tackling the problem at its root by improving health
      communication in localized languages.\n \nEffective health communication in
      a pandemic requires systematic investments in health infrastructure and adequate
      training for academics and journalists. Fortunately, many organizations are
      meeting this gap and providing resources and responses to tackle such misinformation.
      Organizations such as SciLine, the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN),
      and COVID Explained have developed several resources, unpacking claims about
      COVID-19. While many such projects focus on general misinformation related to
      COVID-19, there is an increased need for addressing vaccine misinformation specifically,
      and to provide the context needed for individuals that speak a variety of different
      languages, with varying health literacy levels.\n  \nThere is a paucity of evidence-based
      information for journalists, fact-checkers and everyday WhatsApp users to effectively
      unpack disingenuous claims, whether it be anti-vaccine propaganda or the marketing
      of natural and herbal remedies as cures for the coronavirus.\n \nIndia has detected
      1.2 million cases and 30,000 deaths of COVID-19, according to the Ministry of
      Health & Family Welfare. Given the difficulties around active surveillance in
      India, experts believe the actual number could be even higher. Even if official
      estimates are to be believed, however, the contagion of misinformation threatens
      to derail existing efforts and present roadblocks to the development of a future
      vaccine.\n \nIt is now more imperative than ever before to prioritize effective
      health communication in order to tackle the scourge of misinformation, especially
      as we double down on efforts to rein in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n \n*Mohit Nair

    body: |-
      The [2020 version of the Association of Computational Linguistics (ACL) conference](https://acl2020.org/), originally planned to take place in Seattle, happened virtually from July 5th to 10th. This year's ACL, which is among the top publication venues for natural language processing researchers around the world, set many records as it was the first ACL event to ever be held virtually and had record numbers in volunteers, participants (overall and across continents) and accepted papers.

      ACL 2020 featured many papers addressing challenges in misinformation, fact-checking and computational journalism, with Microsoft Research Asia having three automated fact-checking papers in the main conference alone. Overall, most of these papers introduced new and important challenges to the community and some proposed new models to solve or improve on existing tasks. Throughout the rest of this blog post, I'll try to highlight some of these efforts.

      ### Main Conference Papers

      This year, there were a number of papers addressing misinformation and fact-checking from an NLP perspective. Here are some of the papers that caught my attention:

      #### [That is a Known Lie: Detecting Previously Fact-Checked Claims](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.332.pdf)

      The paper by [Qatar Computing Research Institute](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/qcri/about) (QCRI) team led by [Preslav Nakov](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/staff/dr-preslav-nakov), addresses the claim matching problem which [has been of interest to Meedan](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/videos/countering-the-covid-19-misinfodemic-with-text-similarity-and-social-data-science/) and the fact-checking community. Technology is needed to meet the ever-increasing volume of claims coming in to fact-checkers around the globe. One important and effective solution to this problem is the detection of duplicate and previously fact-checked claims. This paper presents two claim-matching datasets and proposes a mix of information retrieval and text embedding based models as potential solutions for the claim-matching problem.

      #### [Generating Fact Checking Explanations](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.656.pdf)

      Extracting supporting evidence from discussions around a claim is the premise of this paper by [Isabelle Augenstein](https://isabelleaugenstein.github.io/)'s group at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/). Using a dataset of facts from Politifact, the authors derive explanations using a BERT-based sentence selection model for each fact-checked statement. They show that the extracted explanations can help automated fact-checking models improve on veracity prediction tasks by jointly learning to do both fact-checking and explanation extraction.

      #### [DeSePtion: Dual Sequence Prediction and Adversarial Examples for Improved Fact-Checking](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.761.pdf) 

      Work by authors from [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/), [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) and [George Washington University](https://www.cs.seas.gwu.edu/) provides resources and models for studying and understanding challenges in automated fact-checking. They address three types of challenges that confuse current automated fact-verification systems: multiple propositions (the need to synthesize evidence from various sources), temporal reasoning, and ambiguity and lexical variation. Their solutions largely use pointer networks, BERT and reinforcement learning algorithms. The code and resource of this extensive work is [publicly available](https://github.com/chridey/fever2-columbia).

      #### [Masking Actor Information Leads to Fairer Political Claims Detection](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.404.pdf)

      This is a short paper on identifying political claims from text that proposes a method for increasing fairness to minority groups in these models. The simple but useful reference masking method presented by University of Stuttgart researchers on a German newspaper dataset shows claim-detection models can be fairer to minorities without significant performance drops.

      #### [Prta: A System to Support the Analysis of Propaganda Techniques in the News](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-demos.32.pdf)

      This demonstration paper by QCRI won an honorable mention award in the demo category. The paper builds on top of their prior work on propaganda analysis and provides statistics on different propaganda techniques used in media outlets. You can also [submit](https://www.tanbih.org/prta) your propaganda of choice and see the ways it is trying to convince you.

      For a more detailed picture of computational journalism research at ACL 2020, I also recommend looking at the following papers:

      - MSR Asia [Papers](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.655.pdf) on [Automated](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.539.pdf)  [FactChecking](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.549.pdf)
      - [Understanding the Language of Political Agreement and Disagreement in Legislative Texts](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.476.pdf)
      - [NSTM: Real-Time Query-Driven News Overview Composition at Bloomberg](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-demos.40.pdf)
      - ["Who said it, and Why?" Provenance for Natural Language Claims](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.406.pdf)
      - [DTCA: Decision Tree-based Co-Attention Networks for Explainable Claim Verification](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.97.pdf)
      - [GCAN: Graph-aware Co-Attention Networks for Explainable Fake News Detection on Social Media](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.48/)

      ### Workshops

      Often mini-conferences of their own, workshops at ACL maintain high quality proceedings and hold fascinating invited talks. The line up for workshops this year included a variety of topics ranging from neural text generation and translation to educational applications and conversational AI. In the remainder of this post, I try to summarize the workshops I found interesting and relevant to computational journalism.

      #### [FEVER Workshop](https://fever.ai/workshop.html)

      The recent meeting of the workshop for fact extraction and verification included an excellent line-up of invited speakers and contributed work. This was the third edition of the excellent workshop organized by [Andreas Vlachos](https://andreasvlachos.github.io/), [James Thorne](https://jamesthorne.co.uk/), [Oana Cocarascu](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~oc511/), [Christos Christodoulopoulos](http://christos-c.com/) and [Arpit Mittal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fDORjGoAAAAJ&hl=en). The opening talk by [Isabelle Augenstein](https://isabelleaugenstein.github.io/) on the importance of explainable fact-checking first took a deep dive into extracting supporting evidence for fact veracity and then moved on to presenting work on claim understanding and what needs to be fact-checked. The overall sentiment within participants and speakers, as reiterated by [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/), was that we need more evidence-based and explanatory approaches in FEVER. Among other fascinating talks, [Philip Resnik](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/) presented work on framing and how it affects our perception of news and facts. Through years of research on language framing, he portrayed that harmful content isn't always false information and sometimes more harm can be done with true information framed to serve a purpose. In his closing remarks, he called for a more "FEVER"ish approach to tackling our misinformation problems, meaning that we should go beyond labeling content fake or true and look at more complicated analyses of the phenomenon.

      #### [NLP COVID-19 Workshop](https://www.nlpcovid19workshop.org/)

      This ACL workshop was formed as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic in a short timeframe and contained many interesting peer-reviewed COVID-related papers, including research by NYU and University of Waterloo on [Rapidly Deploying a Neural Search Engine for the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset: Preliminary Thoughts and Lessons Learned](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PlUA_mgGaPq). This system and paper provided a neural search engine for COVID-19 literature and is available at [covidex.ai](http://covidex.ai/). With the large number of submissions in such short timelines, the workshop deserves a closer look at its proceedings.

      You can find the [full list of submitted papers here](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2020/Workshop/NLP-COVID).

      ### Final Thoughts

      With uncertainty caused by the pandemic and upcoming elections, it's both overwhelming and exciting to be involved in computational journalism research. It is refreshing to see the rapid community response to the pandemic and the evolution of computational misinformation research.

      Presented research on misinformation and fact-checking at ACL 2020 seems to be moving away from "automatic" misinformation detection towards addressing specific questions more in demand of journalists and fact-checkers. Acknowledging that any potential solution to the current misinformation problems will require more than just "detection", the shift in focus in this year's papers portrays the NLP community's maturity in understanding the deeper, more important underlying requirements for a working solution. Meedan has long advocated for an approach that augments and empowers human fact-checkers and does not try to replace them, an orientation that is evident in our [open-source fact-checking software, Check](https://meedan.com/check). There are many ways that NLP can assist fact-checkers, and even papers at ACL not specifically about misinformation such as text similarity, summarization, and cross-lingual alignment are relevant to tasks fact-checkers need to perform.

      This community growth could not have been possible without interdisciplinary collaborations and publication venues with journalism experts and researchers. As brought up both during and in their followup questionnaire, the FEVER workshop was interested in community feedback on future direction and next steps. Building on top of the fruitful interdisciplinary collaboration and the need for a future plan, now seems like a good time for a stronger NLP and journalism alliance in planning our next moves against information disorders.

      ### Acknowledgements

    body: "As the COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide, media narratives have focused
      first on how this has affected the global north, even while [experts flagged](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-coronavirus-rio-favela/2020/03/20/2522b49e-6889-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html
      \"Brazil’s densely packed favelas brace for coronavirus: ‘It will kill a lot
      of people.’\") that the worst was yet to come. In the past few months, the pandemic
      has hit emerging economies with dense urban populations in which social distancing
      and isolation are impossibilities. \n\nLatin America's societies have seen the
      horror of [bodies piling](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/bodies-piled-ecuador-covid-19-hotspot-200617142117507.html
      \"When bodies piled up: Inside Ecuador's first coronavirus hotspot\") on the
      streets of Ecuador, among the dead those of at least [9 journalists](https://medium.com/chicas-poderosas/los-riesgos-de-cubrir-la-pandemia-en-ecuador-fad831054013
      \"Los riesgos de cubrir la pandemia en Ecuador\") that died because of lack
      of protection equipment during work. At the same time, Brazil now has the [second
      highest ](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html \"COVID-19 Johns Hopkins Dashboard\")
      death toll in the world, and the favelas population are left to their own luck
      while [self-organizing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-coronavirus-rio-favela/2020/03/20/2522b49e-6889-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html
      \"Brazil’s densely packed favelas brace for coronavirus: ‘It will kill a lot
      of people.’\") to fight against the virus. \n\nThe pandemic arrives in a context
      that according to the [2019 Reporters Without Borders Index](https://rsf.org/en/2019-world-press-freedom-index-cycle-fear
      \"2019 World Press Freedom Index – A cycle of fear \"), has seen in the last
      years a surge in corruption, increasingly concentrated media ownership and violence
      against journalists. This has contributed to a spike in fear and self-censorship,
      state censorship and authoritarian excesses, disinformation and cyber-harassment.\n\nMedia
      concentration turned historically family-owned companies into conglomerates.
      [UNESCO](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000246421 \"Unesco\") has
      warned about the threats of this process: when combined with property concentration,
      geographic concentration also affects pluralism and diversity, as it generates
      a uniformity of agendas and informational contents. Concentration is perceived
      as ‘indirect censorship’ by international and supranational organisations such
      as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.\n\nA form of media ecosystem
      response to this oppressive scenario is the emerging number of independent media
      outlets. A great example is in the Northern Triangle where [independent media](https://niemanreports.org/articles/how-independent-journalists-in-latin-america-are-finding-new-ways-to-hold-power-to-account/
      \"How Independent Journalists in Latin America are Finding New Ways to Hold
      Power to Account\") has been on the rise as well as in most of Latin America.
      [Public interest](http://waccglobal.org/articles/a-new-wave-of-public-service-journalism-in-latin-america
      \"A new wave of public service journalism in Latin America\") journalism is
      trying to make governments accountable to their oppressions and mistakes. \n\nIn
      2021 we aim to expand our support to new partners initiatives in these regions
      of Latin America, such as the Northern Triangle (Honduras, Salvador and Guatemala)
      that in the last decade have seen violence escalate since a wave of street gang
      members  deported from [prisons in the USA](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2018/12/08/the-northern-triangle-is-becoming-less-murderous
      \"The Northern Triangle is becoming less murderous\") arrived in El Salvador.
      This and years of unrest has [started waves of migration ](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/central-americas-turbulent-northern-triangle
      \"Central America’s Turbulent Northern Triangle\") that have resulted in millions
      of people seeking better living conditions. For an example, see the work of
      Chicas Poderosas on [migration stories in Latin America](https://10-historias-migrantes.webflow.io/)
      covering minorities published in 2019 with Check Global support.\n\nOur work
      with the [Check Global  project](https://meedan.com/projects/check-global/)
      is to address inequities in access to information, increase media literacy skills
      and counter misinformation, but how does this look during a global pandemic
      and economic crisis?  Much of it involves supporting our partners in adapting
      their strategies and plans to better respond to their communities’ needs during
      this time. Here’s what we’ve been doing, and what’s coming next:\n\n![Chicas
      Poderosas: An agile response to COVID-19](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/6L6xpRBHVpgIDLFUzWjQH4/1fa06b3c0215c861fa835c752dd58ded/EYtMtTTXYAEkO0X)\n<p
      class=\"caption\">Chicas Poderosas's new MOOC focused on women and leadership
      skills. Image from Chicas Poderosas.</p>\n\n### Chicas Poderosas: An agile response
      to COVID-19 \n\n[Chicas Poderosas](https://chicaspoderosas.org/) has adapted
      with agility to this new challenge. A global, 18-country community that promotes
      change by inspiring and fostering the development of women in the media, they
      migrated their flagship event to an online format, creating their first Online
      Mediathon in Ecuador that is scheduled to happen at the end of 2020 , in which
      100 women will be trained in journalism and media skills. \n\nThey have also
      launched  [\"Women, Power and the Media\"](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/JC/mujerpoderymedios.html)
      a MOOC with attendees numbering as high as 3,900 women and increasing everyday,
      with support from Check Global and the [Google News Initiative](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/)
      and hosted by the [Knight Center](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/). The online
      course has been designed for women who work in the media and journalism field
      so they can strengthen their current leadership tools, acquire new ones and
      learn from the professional practices of other women leaders. The community
      that is organically being formed around it created job boards to share opportunities,
      study groups for LGBTQIA+ members in Guatemala and journalists that work with
      gender issues. This course will be translated to arabic and localized to the
      [NAWA Media](https://nawamedia.org/) website an open-access platform aimed at
      media professionals and journalism students in North Africa and Western Asia
      (NAWA) offering them support through training resources. \n \nAnother response
      to the pandemic was [Conversaciones Poderosas: COVID-19](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHhWDKq8tA7U9BMlCkHA7uLSCo0gCMEga)
      (Powerful Conversations) a series of 8 facilitated conversations between media
      professionals published on the Chicas Poderosas YouTube channel, an initiative
      aimed to support Spanish-speaking journalists covering COVID–19.\n\nUnderstanding
      that women in Latin America have long been denied agency in healthcare and that
      this new virus is one of several health concerns, the project _Hermanas [Sisters]:
      Information to accelerate women's health_ was created to transform medical information
      and studies into accessible, attractive, and high-impact content, providing
      clear, verified information that will normalize prevention behaviors and question
      stereotypes. This will be shared under a Creative Commons license so it can
      be localized, translated and applied to other contexts.\n\n![Animal Politico:

      Supporting journalism innovation during a pandemic\n\nThe elections in Mexico,
      Brazil, Venezuela, Paraguay, Colombia and El Salvador prompted an increase in
      attacks on journalists, especially by politicians, government officials and
      cyber-activists, and reinforced a climate of mistrust and animosity towards
      the media. Journalists are frequent [targets of death threats](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-19955-wave-threats-journalists-colombia-scares-and-awakens-memory-years-violence-against-pre),
      physical violence, and abduction.\n\n[Animal Politico](https://www.animalpolitico.com/),
      our Check Global partner based in Mexico, suffered cyber attacks in 2019 as
      a result of the independent work they do in what [Amnesty International](https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/countries-cracked-down-on-asylum-and-the-right-to-protest-in-the-americas-in-2019/)
      has called one of the world’s deadliest countries to journalists. This year
      we are supporting them to continue their fact-checking work and research in
      social media to understand how disinformation that appears to be inoffensive
      is often focused on promoting hate speech and gender issues. They in turn are
      creating media literacy content in multimedia formats to access new and young
      audiences.\n\n![COVID-19 Micro-grants: Support for women-led grassroots organizations](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/4fpXTP7P2u94ySEuHTfMMX/06cf703ae12797dbbecfe0100d7bfb56/Ruda29_1_.jpg)\n<p

      COVID-19 Micro-grants: Support for women-led grassroots organizations\n\nBeyond
      our existing partners, Check Global has been keen to support a broader range
      of organizations. This year, we launched [25 micro-grants](https://meedan.com/blog/25-grassroots-projects-awarded-through-the-check-global-covid-19-fund/)
      to support independent grassroots organisations. Amongst them, we supported
      7 organizations in Latin America. One such group is [Coletivo Cirandeiras](https://www.instagram.com/cirandeiras/)(Collective
      Cirandeiras), who will produce podcast episodes on the stories of women leaders
      in underrepresented and marginalized communities in Brazil. We will also be
      supporting the fact-checking work of an alliance of two independent media outlets
      in Cuba [Periodismo de Barrio](https://www.periodismodebarrio.org/) (Journalism
      of the Barrio) and [elTOQUE](https://eltoque.com/) (The Touch) to increase regional
      awareness in matters related to the pandemic. \n\nAnother fact-checking initiative
      [Eté Checagem](https://www.etechecagem.com/)(Eté Fact-Checking) works and specializes
      in human rights and guidelines relating to the women, youth and LGBTQIA population
      in Brazil. [Ruda Coletiva](https://rudacolectiva.com)(Ruda Collective) a group
      of Latin America women photographers, will do a visual investigation of the
      impact that the pandemic has had in the food chain throughout the region. With
      the theme “From my window” [Coletivo Mulherias](https://mulherias.blogosfera.uol.com.br/)
      (Mulherias Collective) will coordinate a group of women journalists living in
      the slums of Brazil portraying their routine during the pandemic. In Ecuador
      we will hear [Isabel Gonzales and Chicas Poderosas](https://www.instagram.com/chicaspoderosasec/)
      develop a new podcast that aims to inform and support the journalist community
      in Latin America suffering the consequences of COVID-19 in their work. And in
      El Salvador we will support the work of photographer [Giuzeppe Dezza](http://www.gdezza.net)
      and his work on documenting the impacts of the pandemic in the country.\n             \nMeedan
      has experience running projects of [open-source investigations](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2020/01/27/help_bellingca_and_tbij_investigate_airstrikes/),
      collaborative journalism and [innovation](https://meedan.com/blog/how-meedan-supported-three-reporting-initiatives-in-asia/).
      Bringing this knowledge to grassroot organizations and adding them to the Check
      Global network brings possibilities of collaboration and building better products
      by having these organizations use our [open source software Check](https://meedan.com/check)
      in new ways, while tapping into the broader Check Global network initiatives,
      such as our network training calls and webinars, and potentially accessing expert-sourced
      information from our [COVID-19 Expert Database.](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/)\n\n###
      Datos desaparecidos: memory as resistance \n\nThe rise of [conservative](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/16/the-trumpification-of-the-latin-american-right/),
      oppressive and misogynist governments in the region has led to a [spike in feminist
      activism](https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/oppressive-sexist-policies-galvanize-bold-fight-for-womens-rights-in-2018/)
      and women jornalists uniting in [public manifestations](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-21674-latin-american-women-journalists-march-equal-rights-and-against-gender-violence)
      in Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, México, Chile and Brazil to advocate
      for human rights. These democratic activities led by activists, protesters and
      civil societies have been brutally shut down by governments. According to Amnesty
      International, these actions have resulted in the [death of 210](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/americas/)
      people involved in protests. \n\nIn this digital age, memory is now born digitally,
      disseminated by activists and underrepresented communities in private platforms
      such as Facebook and Instagram. In 1973, the government of Argentina began disappearing
      people as a form of oppression, a practice that continues today in a number
      of Latin American countries under the frightful neologism of *desaparecidos*,
      or “the disappeared.” Today, we also struggle with *datos desaparecidos*, or
      disappeared data. Memory is a living thing and as a social practice it changes
      in each interaction, each time it is recalled. By preserving digital activism
      media and freedom of expression is a way to preserve integrity of these narratives.
      \ It is important to safekeep these digital archives and memories from private
      company servers and interests. Open source technology can serve as an alternative.
      \n\nOur work in this discussion is facilitating and organizing community initiatives
      to address this issue, during events such as RightsCon 2020 and [Internet Freedom
      Glitter Meetup](https://meedan.com/events/internet-freedom-festival-glitter-meetup-recordkeepers-of-the-resistance/).
      We hope to open and share knowledge with intersectional feminist and freedom
      of expression communities and worldwide on how to safekeep historical records
      as the world fights a pandemic. We invite you to attend these events in our
      efforts to develop memory as a form of resistance.\n\nYou can read a bit more
      on [how memory has been erased during COVID-19 in Brazil](https://meedan.com/blog/covid-19-in-brazil-memory-as-a-form-of-resistance/)

      Media Literacy: supporting media education to fight the misinfodemic \n\nThe

      in scientific and history [negationism](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/03/denialism-what-drives-people-to-reject-the-truth)
      propagated by these governments, resulting in actions that will affect millions

      and [Argentina](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/04/thousands-scientists-argentina-strike-protest-budget-cuts),
      while in [Chile](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47525165) the system is failing

      and training initiatives as a response to the [misinformation](https://aosfatos.org/noticias/bolsonaro-foi-o-mais-citado-em-desinformacao-checada-no-facebook-em-2019/)
      platform that these governments have chosen to run. Media literacy in Brazil
      is now a [subject](https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/educacao/noticia/2019-02/educacao-midiatica-forma-cidadao-consciente-dizem-especialistas)
      that will be added to the mandatory curriculum of schools.\n\nEducation is a
      strategy to [fight misinformation](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000246421)
      and prevent future societal situations as the one we are living by training
      future journalists and university students in understanding media work. We can
      train teachers on how to do this inside Check and using our resources. It can
      be used to expand product applicability by creating workflows inside Check designed
      specifically for this purpose. This would be a key asset for future partnerships
      with universities, communities and educational institutes. If you are interested
      in this opportunity, please get in touch. We have the Check U programme, with
      a 10-module curriculum designed specifically for health misinformation that
      can be implemented by schools, and we are keen to partner with a local educator
      to ensure these resources are translated and localized to Spanish and Portuguese.\n\n###
      What's next for Check Global\n\nThe situation in Latin America continues to
      present numerous challenges that COVID-19 exacerbates and that will have lasting
      effects long after the pandemic is over. Our work at Meedan is to continue the
      support of our partners' impact during this time and to expand the access to
      information in the region. To achieve this, we will build on shared knowledge
      from our Check Global network and communities in NAWA, Asia Pacific and Africa.
      They have unifying health and political aspects during this pandemic, share
      colonial contexts, face similar issues and are crafting their own solutions
      as they lead the pathway to a more equitable internet and future."

    body: "Last week I was fortunate to receive corrective surgery on my disabled
      arm, a remnant of an injury from over 9 months ago. When the COVID-19 pandemic
      hit, changing all of our plans, it understandably delayed non-essential medical
      procedures like the one I needed.\n \nJuly 2020 marks [30 years since the passage
      of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/30th_anniversary/index.html).
      Twelve years ago the [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
      (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html)
      came into effect, which was the first United Nations (UN) human rights treaty
      of the 21st century, and also the UN convention with the largest number of signatories
      in history on its opening day.  \n\nAs I recover, I am reflecting on what these
      mean for my friends and colleagues with disabilities, including disabilities
      that are permanent or longer-term than my own. \n\nWe have made progress through
      high-level decisions and cultural shifts. For example, plans for people with
      disabilities are now included in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, the
      Paris Agreement on Global Climate Change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster
      Risk Reduction, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development.
      Yet there is much more to do  – we still have not achieved universal access,
      and people with disabilities are being disproportionately affected by the COVID-19
      pandemic in multiple ways.\n\n- People with disabilities are at a higher risk
      of severe symptoms and death from COVID-19. A [study published in the *Disability
      and Health Journal*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245650/)
      found that there is a higher COVID-19 fatality rate among people with intellectual
      and developmental disabilities (IDD). The researchers also found a higher concentration
      of COVID-19 cases at younger ages for people with IDD. Last month, the American
      Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) shared [devastating statistics](https://www.aclu.org/news/disability-rights/covid-19-deaths-in-nursing-homes-are-not-unavoidable-they-are-the-result-of-deadly-discrimination/)
      on the anniversary of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v.
      L.C., which recognized that unjustified segregation of people with disabilities
      is a form of discrimination: Nearly 50% of COVID-19 deaths have been among people
      living in nursing homes, psychiatric hospitals, and other congregate settings
      for people with disabilities, while this population only makes up less than
      1% of the U.S. population. The ACLU warns us that these excess and inequitable
      deaths are “not unavoidable – they are the result of deadly discrimination.”\n\n-
      People with disabilities are also excluded as much of our world moves online
      during the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting everything from education and employment
      to essential services and social connection. There is [growing worldwide concern](https://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=2322)
      about the digital divide, where many people still lack access to technologies
      like computers and smartphones, not to mention affordable as well as reliable
      internet and even electricity. The most affected tend to be [lower-income](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/07/digital-divide-persists-even-as-lower-income-americans-make-gains-in-tech-adoption/),
      [older generations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/technology/virus-older-generation-digital-divide.html),
      [racial and ethnic minorities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/20/smartphones-help-blacks-hispanics-bridge-some-but-not-all-digital-gaps-with-whites/),
      [sexual and gender minorities](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/GenderDigital/HRBDT_submission.pdf),
      and [people with disabilities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/07/disabled-americans-are-less-likely-to-use-technology/),
      with many intersectionalities. Exacerbating this, people with disabilities can
      face additional barriers, such as:\n\n\n1.   Increased risks of online harassment
      and discrimination\n\n2.   Lack of adaptations for limited abilities to see,
      hear, and understand content\n\n3.  Lack of adaptations for limited physical
      abilities to use devices (ex.    following my injury, I learned to type using
      one hand supplemented with voice recognition software)\n\nIt is more crucial
      than ever to mitigate barriers like these during a pandemic, where online access
      to quality information and essential activities can directly influence health
      outcomes.\n\nHere at Meedan, the Digital Health Lab is working to address “viral
      misinformation that facilitates the spread of a particular health outcome or
      disease,” also called a “misinfodemic,” by increasing access to expert-sourced
      information about COVID-19. \n\nMeedan’s efforts to increase access include
      avoiding jargon to make information readable by the general public, providing
      a glossary with simplified definitions of scientific terms, translating information
      for non-English speakers, and disseminating information across diverse media
      channels. In this process, we cannot forget to include people with disabilities.
      Leaving out people with disabilities means hurting a significant proportion
      of humanity: The World Health Organization (WHO) [estimates that over 1 billion](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health)
      people experience some form of disability. Additionally, the ADA and CRPD require
      making online content, services, and systems accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nEquality
      under the law does not automatically translate to equity in everyday practice.
      We have to do the hard work of building the inclusive world we’d like to see,
      and we need to continuously work on addressing ableism and centering disability
      justice. Meedan’s Digital Health Lab is striving to increase access to COVID-19
      information for all, including people with disabilities, and we invite you to
      join us.\n\nResources:\n\n[ADA Best Practices Chapter 5 Website Accessibility](https://www.ada.gov/pcatoolkit/chap5toolkit.htm)\n[Federal

    body: "A few weeks ago, in a WhatsApp message group with family members, a forwarded
      message showed up on my screen that read: “The COVID-19 plot thickens, please
      do read.” \n \nIn India, where my family is from, it is typical for a day to
      begin with five or more messages in different family or work WhatsApp groups.
      The messages range from friendly updates and innocent gifs to threads pressuring
      you to forward messages to nine people in order to avoid ill-fated planetary
      alignments.\n \nWhat followed the COVID-19 message a few weeks ago was an elaborate
      thread containing false claims about COVID-19 as a lab-made virus, intended
      to boost the sales of Remdesivir and benefit Bill Gates and George Soros. The
      forwarded text falsely claimed that the entire COVID-19 crisis is a well-orchestrated
      effort at the highest levels by Gates, Soros, Obama, and Clinton to develop
      a COVID-19 vaccine, with “the ultimate motivation of making billions of dollars
      in profits at the cost of only losing a mere million human lives.” This particular
      conspiracy theory was disseminated on Facebook in the United States, and quickly
      spread through WhatsApp in India as well.\n \nIn the United States, journalists
      are battling misinformation on open or partially open social platforms like
      Facebook and Twitter. In India, as in other parts of the world, the problem
      may be trickier to catch—and harder to prevent, because misinformation spreads
      predominantly in closed chat groups on WhatsApp, away from the sights of content
      moderators and fact-checkers.  Blatant misinformation campaigns like the one
      I received recently are dangerous under normal circumstances, and downright
      deadly in the midst of a pandemic. Misinformation makes it harder for healthcare
      authorities to effectively communicate critical health information to wider
      audiences.\n \nWhatsApp misinformation in India sows distrust in healthcare
      institutions and encourages disregard for basic public health advice. Often
      disguised as medical advice, doctored videos of a prominent Indian doctor advising
      viewers not to get tested for coronavirus were circulated over 5,000 times on
      Facebook and Twitter. False rumors have led to many Indian doctors and frontline
      healthcare workers being evicted from their homes. This is especially important
      in the Indian context, where unfiltered and inaccurate information spreads rapidly
      on WhatsApp, and can quickly hamper efforts to trace, isolate, and care for
      COVID cases. Healthcare workers attempting to stop the spread of COVID-19 have
      been attacked by mobs across India as recently as April, and misinformation
      has only exacerbated the violence.\n \nIn March 2020, one particular message
      circulating on WhatsApp caught the attention of the Government of India’s Press
      Information Bureau (PIB). The message falsely claimed that the Government was
      spraying “CV vaccine gas inside the country, through airplanes.”\n \nThe official
      Twitter account of PIB (@PIBFactCheck) responded by stating: “Amidst #Coronavirusoutbreak,
      misinformation on CV Vaccine gas spread out through Airplanes is circulating
      on social media. NO such action has been planned out by the Indian Government.
      Get your facts from trusted sources. Do not amplify #fakenews!”\n \nAge-old
      rumors about vaccine safety are now being tailored to COVID-19 audiences to
      promote vaccine hesitancy, which could derail efforts not only for the eventual
      implementation of a COVID-19 vaccine, but also for the continuation of routine
      vaccinations for myriad other diseases.\n \nThe misinformation amid the pandemic
      is not limited to vaccine hesitancy. In some  parts of India, the indigenous
      cow has been elevated to new heights and questionable treatments, such as cow
      urine, have been marketed as an effective remedy against the novel coronavirus.
      Such claims may have gained legitimacy under the current Government, which created
      an open call for research & development proposals that examine dubious pseudo-scientific
      treatments such as “cowpathy” for “medicine and health” in February this year.
      In such circumstances, it becomes even more difficult to distinguish science
      from pseudoscience in a pandemic, especially as misinformation seems to travel
      even faster than COVID-19 in India.\n \nIn Mizoram, approximately 15 individuals
      were arrested for spreading a fictitious and official-sounding directive from
      state officials, asking local citizens from outside Mizoram to return home at
      once. Similar arrests have taken place in Rajasthan, Odisha, and other Indian
      states. Successive state governments have responded to misinformation by conducting
      mass arrests rather than tackling the problem at its root by improving health
      communication in localized languages.\n \nEffective health communication in
      a pandemic requires systematic investments in health infrastructure and adequate
      training for academics and journalists. Fortunately, many organizations are
      meeting this gap and providing resources and responses to tackle such misinformation.
      Organizations such as SciLine, the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN),
      and COVID Explained have developed several resources, unpacking claims about
      COVID-19. While many such projects focus on general misinformation related to
      COVID-19, there is an increased need for addressing vaccine misinformation specifically,
      and to provide the context needed for individuals that speak a variety of different
      languages, with varying health literacy levels.\n  \nThere is a paucity of evidence-based
      information for journalists, fact-checkers and everyday WhatsApp users to effectively
      unpack disingenuous claims, whether it be anti-vaccine propaganda or the marketing
      of natural and herbal remedies as cures for the coronavirus.\n \nIndia has detected
      1.2 million cases and 30,000 deaths of COVID-19, according to the Ministry of
      Health & Family Welfare. Given the difficulties around active surveillance in
      India, experts believe the actual number could be even higher. Even if official
      estimates are to be believed, however, the contagion of misinformation threatens
      to derail existing efforts and present roadblocks to the development of a future
      vaccine.\n \nIt is now more imperative than ever before to prioritize effective
      health communication in order to tackle the scourge of misinformation, especially
      as we double down on efforts to rein in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n \n*Mohit Nair

    body: "The proliferation of misinformation and disinformation online throughout
      the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly yielded a corresponding ‘infodemic.’ Information
      around the novel coronavirus is shifting daily and narratives vary based on
      the contexts in which we live, work and socialize.  \n\nThis creates a near-perfect
      recipe for a confusing, substandard information ecosystem and intentionally
      false information. Mis- and disinformation related to the pandemic is not just
      \ harmful for individuals, but, because of the nature of the virus, low-quality
      information also adversely impacts the collective and directly contributes to
      greater numbers of cases and deaths. \n\nAs both a graduate student pursuing
      an MPH at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and as a young person
      raised in the American South, I’ve had a lens into two contrasting sides of
      the COVID-19 online informational arena. On the one hand, I have access to some
      of the highest-quality and timely information on the pandemic. On the other,
      I have a lens into American skepticism of the CDC and WHO, and clear gaps in
      which  public health authorities  (such as from Harvard Chan, the CDC, and WHO
      themselves), are not effectively reaching the general public, particularly in
      the digital realm. \n\nMisinformation is highly challenging to regulate, often
      because it spreads  informally across a range of social media platforms. Evidence
      shows that traditional public health interventions on social media, which present
      text-heavy facts on platforms, are inadequate for obtaining wide-reach. This
      becomes particularly clear when those interventions are compared to the reach
      of mis- and disinformation. Exacerbating this challenge is the fact that news
      sources are often not staffed with in-house public health experts, and given
      that, there are significant bottlenecks within academia that preclude a free-flowing
      stream of the most up-to-date health information for journalists.\n\nIn order
      to address this set of challenges, student group Students Against COVID-19 (SAC)
      and [Meedan's COVID-19 Expert Database](https://learnaboutcovid19.org/) are
      partnering to pair the latest expert health information with digestible infographics
      tailored to online spaces and resharing. Through the partnership, SAC will leverage
      the Meedan Digital Health Lab’s team of experts to translate their most recent
      COVID-19 updates and answers to pressing questions into highly accessible visuals
      particularly intended for online audiences globally. Graphics will be posted
      alongside expert answers on the [learnaboutcovid19.org](http://learnaboutcovid19.org/)
      database for easy viewing and sharing. This pairing of content and visuals has
      the potential for broad impact in mitigating health misinformation online and,
      in turn, improved public health outcomes. \n\n![Zoonotic Diseases](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/3hzT12rbPNOOF4inKiGxzp/763ba6cb8a26539ddcd96eebb4e9adaa/Screen_Shot_2020-06-26_at_2.56.45_PM.png)!
