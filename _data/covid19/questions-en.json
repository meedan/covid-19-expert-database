    "Country question was sourced from": [

    "Background and context": "Sugar is a natural part of all foods that have carbohydrates, including fruits, vegetables, grains, beans and legumes, and dairy products. These foods are all part of a well-balanced diet. When looking at diet, consuming sugars as part of unprocessed, whole foods is not usually a concern because of the other health benefits that come from those foods. Added sugar, however, is a significant concern.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines advise that adults and children limit their daily intake of added sugar to less than 10% of total calories (about 50 grams or about 12 teaspoons) to prevent excess weight gain, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and dental cavities. Other leading health organizations including the American Heart Association recommend further reducing added sugar (no more than 9 teaspoons or 36 grams of sugar per day for men; no more than 6 teaspoons or 25 grams per day for women).  One 12-ounce soda, for example, has 8 teaspoons (about 32 grams) of added sugar.\n\nThere are many different kinds of sugar used in food preparation and processing, including white or brown sugar, honey, syrups (i.e. maple, rice, golden, corn, agave), molasses, coconut sugar, fruit juice concentrate, malt sugar, and others. Other common sources of dietary sugar are often called “hidden” sugar because they are included in processed foods yet can be difficult to find on food labels, if the food is labeled at all. Examples of “hidden” sugars include sugar sweetened beverages (i.e. cola, soda, flavored milk products, some juices) and processed or packaged foods (including products cookies, cereal products, sweetened dried fruits, sauces and condiments like ketchup or salad dressing, snack foods, and candies).\n\nIf possible, the WHO has said that there may be added health benefits if people are able to decrease their intake to less than 5% (about 25 grams or about 6 teaspoons) per day.\n",
    "What our experts say": "While a varied and balanced diet including fruits and vegetables does help to support the immune system in general, there is no evidence to suggest that special diets, consumption of particular foods, or taking vitamin, mineral, or herbal supplements will prevent, treat or cure COVID-19. For patients with type 2 diabetes, using medications, diet controls (intentionally eating for your condition, like controlling carbohydrate intake and limiting sugar), and exercise to keep blood sugar levels within a normal range has been associated with better outcomes in patients with COVID-19.\n\nWhile diets high in sugar have been shown to impact health, it is not well understood how much added sugar is needed to cause health problems. Studies show that people who consume diets that are high in sugar are more likely to be overweight or obese and have other health problems like insulin resistance (where their bodies are not able to use sugar correctly), type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, kidney disease, or fatty liver disease than people who consume little added sugar. In addition, sugar has been linked with inflammation and poor immune function in the body, especially when a person has insulin resistance or excess body fat. Researchers do not know how much, what type, or under which conditions sugar may cause problems in the short or long term.  \n",

    "Question": "Why is the quarantine now 10 days in the USA? ",
    "Status": "Do not publish",
    "Category": "Quarantine, Testing",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & quarantine",
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC), the incubation period for COVID-19 (the time between exposure to a virus and the first appearance of symptoms) is anywhere between 4 to 14 days. While one study reported that approximately 97% of people with COVID-19 who develop symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection, the body of evidence is still evolving. An earlier study from China estimated that the mean incubation period was about 5.2 days, with approximately 95% of patients experiencing symptoms by 12.5 days.\n\nAt present, there is no evidence that suggests people with COVID-19 can be re-infected after recovering. Once symptoms start to go away, the levels of virus in the body decrease significantly, but tests can sometimes still pick up detectable levels of virus in the body after recovering. There is no evidence to indicate that this poses a transmission risk to other people. These factors play an important role in determining how people quarantine or self-isolate, and for how long. For example, a high proportion of asymptomatic cases may make it difficult to rely on symptoms alone in the absence of adequate testing. Previously, the U.S. CDC  recommended that people who test positive should quarantine until they had two negative tests, but lack of testing availability made this approach impractical. At present, U.S. CDC guidelines recommend that people who have tested positive for COVID-19 or been exposed to the virus should self-isolate and quarantine for 10 days after experiencing symptoms. \n",
    "What our experts say": "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) recently changed quarantine guidelines. They now recommend that most people who test positive for COVID-19 isolate themselves for 10 days after their symptoms begin.\n\nThe CDC previously recommended isolation for 14 days for the general population. They changed it because the latest data shows that people with mild to moderate COVID-19 (the majority of patients) are not likely to be infectious for longer than 10 days after first experiencing symptoms.\n\nIn some cases, people who are experiencing more severe or critical symptoms from COVID-19 may need to quarantine for a longer period of time (up to 20 days after symptoms have started). Asymptomatic patients (individuals who never experience any symptoms, but still test positive for COVID-19) can discontinue quarantine or self-isolation precautions 10 days after their first positive test for COVID-19. \n\nSometimes detectable levels of the virus can still be found in recovered patients, but there is no evidence to indicate that those patients are actually able to transmit the virus to other people. As a result, the U.S. CDC recommends ending quarantine or isolation measures after symptoms have ended.\n\nIn general, given the limited testing availability in the United States and many other countries, the U.S. CDC does not recommend re-testing patients repeatedly if they have completed a 10-day quarantine if they have no symptoms or if symptoms have gone away, as long as the patient does not have other health conditions that leave them immunocompromised. It is important to note that isolation should only end at 10 days if the person hasn’t had a fever for at least 24 hours or any other symptoms have not improved. Patients with severe immune deficiencies may require additional tests in consultation with public health and infection control experts before to ending their quarantine.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) still recommends a 13-day period of self-isolation for any person who has tested positive for COVID-19. For asymptomatic patients who test positive for COVID-10, WHO recommends isolating for 10 days after testing positive. If countries decide to implement testing as part of their isolation strategy, the WHO recommends allowing people to stop isolating after two negative rapid tests at least 24 hours apart. Overall, most public health experts recommend a 10-day quarantine after a positive COVID-19 test, or after the start of symptoms.\n",

    "Background and context": "COVID-19 is a new virus that researchers have been studying for just under six months, so we are still learning new information about it every day, including how long people might be contagious with the virus. Evidence we have so far has given us a solid idea of this length of time for the vast majority of patients. There are still some outliers, but most patients fall within the time frames of contagiousness.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 20, 2020._\n",
    "What our experts say": "Recent research has shown that a person infected with COVID-19 may be able to spread the virus up to 72 hours before they begin to have any symptoms and up to 10 days after symptoms disappear. New studies have suggested that people are the most infectious in the 48 hours before they start to experience any symptoms.\n\n People who test positive for COVID-19 but do not develop symptoms in the 10 days following the test result are considered to be likely no longer contagious after those 10 days. \n\nThere may be exceptions to these timings, so experts recommend 10 days of isolation after either testing positive for the virus, being exposed to a person who has been infected with COVID-19, or developing any symptoms. The best way to ensure you are no long contagious is by having two negative COVID-19 tests more than 24 hours apart.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 20, 2020._\n",

    ],
    "Background and context": "Studies and news articles are circulating about a potential new strain of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Viruses mutate (or change) as part of their life cycle. Some of these changes have more impact on humans than others. \n\nRNA viruses, such as influenza and measles tend to be more prone to mutations, compared to DNA viruses, such as herpes and human papillomavirus. Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that generally have been found to mutate slower than influenza. Some forms of SARS-CoV-2 have mutated and now look different than the original version of it found in China. More research is needed to understand the implications of any mutations in SARS-CoV-2.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 24, 2020_\n",
    "What our experts say": "Studies claim that newer strains of the COVID-19 virus in Europe and the United States spread more rapidly and are more infectious than the original strain of the virus, which was first discovered in Asia in early 2020. \n\nA new strain from the 'D614G spike mutation' can be found in many countries. So far research shows that the new strain of coronavirus does not change the severity of symptoms. The public should continue to take the same recommended preventative measures of wearing a face covering, maintaining 6 feet physical distance and washing their hands with soap and warm water. \n\nViruses constantly change as they reproduce in order to keep spreading into more cells. These changes are called \"mutations,\" and though most mutations are not helpful to the virus, the mutations that help the virus reproduce contribute to the virus spreading. Mutations create a new, updated version of the virus, which we call a \"strain.\" In the case of COVID-19, this newest strain is called the 'G614' and it impacts something called the \"spike proteins\" of the virus, which are the spiky parts on the outside of all coronaviruses that help them get into the body of a person and infect more cells. \n\nThe G614 strain has more spike proteins, which means it is less likely to break off when it is trying to invade the human body, making it  more likely to infect the exposed individual. With this change, some researchers believe the G614 strain of the virus is roughly 10 times more infectious than the earliest versions studied in laboratories. \n\nIt's important to note that these recent studies show that while it is easier for the new strain of the virus to infect people, it does not make the infections any worse or better than other strains of COVID-19. Even if you are more likely to get sick from the virus due to the G614 mutation, your chances of having severe symptoms are the same as they have always been.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 20, 2020_\n",

      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "There have been reports of COVID-19 patients experiencing disease symptoms that impact the blood vessels and vascular system, such as blood clots and damage to the endothelial lining of blood vessels. The existence of vascular COVID-19 symptoms is particularly relevant to patients with certain pre-existing conditions (like hypertension or cardiovascular disease), where infection can mean increased risks of severe illness, serious complications, or death. It is important to note that COVID-19 symptoms can vary widely from person to person, with many experiencing primarily respiratory symptoms, other types of symptoms, multiple types of symptoms at once, or no symptoms at all.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Patients who have been infected with COVID-19 can sometimes develop severe symptoms. Some of these symptoms include things like blood clots, heart problems, and \"COVID toes.\" One thing all of these issues have in common is their link to blood vessels, which are the tubes that deliver blood and oxygen throughout the body. When these tubes, and the cells that line the insides of the tubes (endothelial cells), have challenges carrying and spreading blood to organs and tissues, issues like blood clots, kidney damage, inflammation of the heart and swelling of the brain (encephalitis) can occur in patients. This is why some doctors are calling the virus a \"vasculotropic\" virus (virus that affects blood vessels). More research is needed to present such findings conclusively.\n\nThough COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness, some researchers believe that the virus may be able to move from the lungs into the blood vessels, often causing additional symptoms such as the ones mentioned above. While some patients have been impacted by blood vessel-related symptoms, COVID-19 is still primarily considered a respiratory illness for most patients.\n\n \n\n",

    "Background and context": "There have been many reports of people experiencing a variety of different symptoms as a result of COVID-19 infection. While some symptoms occur in just a few people, other symptoms are more common or “typical” for many people with COVID-19. Typical symptoms for most people with COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, and tiredness; and less common symptoms include headache, loss of taste or smell, rashes or discoloration on fingers or toes, diarrhea, and others according to the World Health Organization. The medical and scientific communities are continually learning about COVID-19 and its symptoms in people based on age, ethnicity, body composition, pre-existing medical conditions, and other factors. The World Health Organization, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other leading health organizations are continually updating their public information to share what is currently known about the COVID-19 and its impacts.\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "COVID-19 can impact people in different ways, but most people who are infected with the virus will only have mild to moderate symptoms and won't need to be hospitalized. Most cases of the virus are not dangerous, but should be taken seriously. The World Health Organization says the most common symptoms are:\n- fever\n- dry cough\n- tiredness\n\nSymptoms fewer people have include: \n- aches and pains\n- sore throat\n- diarrhea\n- conjunctivitis\n- headache\n- loss of taste or smell\n- a rash on skin, or discoloration of fingers or toes\n\nSymptoms that are serious and which mean people should contact a medical professional as soon as possible include:\n- difficulty breathing or shortness of breath\n- chest pain or pressure\n- loss of speech or movement\n\nA person may have mild symptoms for a week or so, and then their condition might worsen rapidly. There maybe others who show no symptom at all. Children, generally speaking, have similar symptoms to adults but with milder illness. People who are older have been shown to have more severe forms of illness.\n\nSome people with COVID-19 have also been experiencing neurological symptoms, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (relating to the stomach and intestines), or both.\n\nBecause we are learning more about this virus every day, including new symptoms, it is important to pay attention to what your body is feeling and contact a medical professional if you begin to experience any of the above symptoms or notice any other changes in how you normally feel.\n\nAdditionally, the United States Centers for Disease Control People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. This list does not include all possible symptoms, but these may appear **2-14 days after exposure** **to the virus**:\n- Fever or chills\n- Cough\n- Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n- Fatigue\n- Muscle or body aches\n- Headache\n- New loss of taste or smell\n- Sore throat\n- Congestion or runny nose\n- Nausea or vomiting\n- Diarrhea\n\nAdditionally, the United States Centers for Disease Control urges people to seek emergency medical care if they are experiencing any of these symptoms:\n\n- Trouble breathing\n- Persistent pain or pressure in the chest\n- New confusion\n- Inability to wake or stay awake\n- Bluish lips or face\n\n",

    ],
    "Background and context": "Health professionals, scientists, and journalists have reported major differences in COVID-19 symptoms from patient to patient. This includes differences in the severity of symptoms, in the duration of symptoms, and in the organs affected. For example, some patients report lingering impacts of COVID-19 lasting months, and the long-term effects of the disease are not fully known yet.\n\nRecently, more news is circulating on the potential long-term impacts of COVID-19 in other parts of the body, beyond the lungs. For example, the media has been reporting o COVID-19 impacts on the heart, following a July 2020 research publication from Germany on heart-related issues in patients recovering from COVID-19. \n\nAdditionally, COVID-19 damage to the brain was reported in the media, following the publication of two studies on British and French patients who experienced symptoms ranging from brain inflammation and delirium to nerve damage and stroke. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, esearchers have already been concerned about the risks of PTSD and delirium in patients who require intensive care. According to a review of previous delirium research published in Intensive Care Medicine, delirium has impacted 20-40% of critically ill patients overall and as many as 80% of those who required a mechanical ventilator.\n\nAlso during July 2020, the impacts of COVID-19 on the kidneys made the news, following updated recommendations from the American Society of Nephrology. On this topic, Mount Sinai Health System Associate Professor of Nephrology and RenalytixAI Co-Founder, Dr. Steven Coca warns about the rise in “chronic kidney disease in the U.S. among those who recovered from the coronavirus...Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic we have seen the highest rate of kidney failure in our lifetimes. It’s a long-term health burden for patients, the medical community — and the U.S. economy.” New research and media reports are continuing to be released.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 20, 2020._\n",
    "What our experts say": "As COVID-19 is a new illness, we don't know all of its short and long-term impacts yet. Most people infected with COVID-19 have mild or no symptoms. Some of the short-term impacts for people with mild symptoms include shortness of breath in the lungs and airways, fever, cough, and body aches. For more severe cases, some short-term impacts can affect several organs. These include pulmonary embolisms (lungs), strokes (brain), and kidney damage due to a lack of oxygen or blood clots. The American Society of Nephrology reported that approximately 50% of patients with severe cases of COVID-19 in intensive care experience kidney failure. One study from Germany published in July 2020 found that 78 out of 100 patients recovering from a COVID-19 infection had heart-related issues that could have serious consequences, such as inflammation and scarring, but the long-term consequences of these findings are still under research. The more severe the case and symptoms of COVID-19 in a person, the more likely major organs are negatively impacted.\n\nThe longer-term effects of COVID-19 are being studied now. Exhaustion, anxiety, dizziness, headaches, muscle aches, loss of taste and smell, and difficulty breathing are often reported in patients who experience symptoms for weeks following their infection with COVID-19. For some people infected with the virus, their symptoms have lasted longer than 100 days.\n\nRecent studies document several long-term impacts of COVID-19 on various organs in the body, including lung scarring, limited lung capacity, neurocognitive impacts, heart damage, renal failure, and more. Vanderbilt University Medical Center launched a study in July 2020 that will study delirium, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression in patients who have been hospitalized with COVID-19. These disabling impacts are also known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), and previous studies of intensive care patients similar to COVID-19 patients suggest that 33-50% experience dementia, 10-20% experience PTSD, and 33% experience major depression. Researchers are also studying whether COVID-19 patients with brain inflammation are at higher risk of autoimmune disorders like demyelination, where the protective coating of nerve cells is attacked by the immune system and may lead to weakness, numbness and difficulty with daily activities.\n\nSince this is a new illness, the real long-term impacts remain unknown. \n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 20, 2020._\n\n",

    "Question": "What do we know about calprotectin and COVID-19?2",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Testing",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & calprotectin",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "France"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Due to recent pre-print studies about calprotectin in COVID-19 patients, many people in the medical and scientific fields are questioning if neutrophils (the white blood cells that release calprotectin) can help doctors predict which patients with COVID-19 might get more sick or develop more difficulty breathing than others. There is no consensus and not enough information to show whether or not calprotectin can help doctors in this way, but researchers are studying the protein in COVID-19 patients now. Some scientists have put forward the idea that calprotectin is linked to inflammation in the body, though usually in the intestines, and are trying to create medications that focus on the protein to decrease inflammation in COVID-19 patients.\n\nOne such pharmaceutical company is named Blade Therapeutics and they have begun phase 2 of clinical trials for a medication designed for COVID-19 patients. This medication, called BLD-2660, tries to stop the immune system from overreacting to the virus and causing organ damage, and it also works to lower the amount of calprotectin in the body. The company hopes that by decreasing the levels of calprotectin, they can help the immune system fight off inflammation and help patients have less severe cases of the virus. It is still too early to tell whether this medication will be successful, but the focus on calprotectin as a marker of inflammation is linked to earlier findings in gastro-enterology studies.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Calprotectin is a type of protein that is released into the body by a type of white blood cell called neutrophils, which help heal damaged tissues and stop infections from spreading. When there is any type of swelling in a person, the amount of neutrophils produced by the immune system increases naturally, in order to help protect and defend the body. When inflammation happens in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (the digestive system in humans and animals that help them digest, absorb, and discard food and liquids), neutrophils move to that area and release the calprotectin protein to help with the process of protecting and defending the body. Because of this, studies have shown that increased levels of calprotectin in the body are linked to higher levels of inflammation in the GI tract, so calprotectin levels are often tested in people with gastrointestinal issues to determine whether or not they have illnesses like inflammatory bowel disease or other infections.\n\nRecent research in a pre-print study shows a potential link between the levels of calprotectin in people infected with COVID-19 and more severe cases of the virus. Pre-print studies are early drafts of studies that have not been published yet in an academic journal, and have not finished going through the process of rigorous peer-reviews for quality of content, methods, and findings. This makes these types of studies less trusted than peer-reviewed publications. \n\nDespite calprotectin normally being used as a marker for inflammation in the intestines, the new research claims that measuring levels of this protein might help determine whether or not people who have tested positive for the coronavirus may develop more severe symptoms. In another pre-print study (which should not be used to guide medical treatments or practices) researchers found a potential link between higher levels of calprotectin in the body of COVID-19 patients with a higher number of patients needing mechanical ventilation (a machine that makes sure your body gets enough oxygen by moving air in and out a patient's lungs). Both these pre-print studies suggest that testing levels of calprotectin in people with the virus might help doctors predict how severe each patient's symptoms and outcomes might be. There is not enough evidence at this time to support this finding, and no scientific consensus whether or not calprotectin can serve as a prediction of how serious the virus will be in some patients. Researchers will continue studying calprotectin in COVID-19 patients, but for now, calprotectin is still used primarily as a way for doctors to see if patients have inflammation in their intestines.\n\n\n\n",

    "Question": "How many days after exposure should one be tested to yield the most accurate results, and with which test?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Testing",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & testing accuracy",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Partner Organization"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA",
      "India"
    ],
    "Background and context": "There have been stories circulating in the media about how some people initially tested negative for COVID-19, only to test positive a couple days later. This has raised questions about what types of testing are most accurate, and when (during the course of an infection) is the most accurate time to test someone.\n\nThere are currently two main types: 1) diagnostic tests (including molecular tests and antigen tests), also known as viral tests, which indicate whether someone has an active infection; and 2) antibody tests, also known as serology tests, which indicate whether someone was likely to have had a COVID-19 infection in the past. An antibody test is not used to detect whether someone has an active COVID-19 infection, in part because it can take 1–3 weeks after infection for the immune system to produce antibodies.\n\nMolecular tests are considered more accurate, in general, than the newer antigen tests for diagnosing the virus. Antigen tests detect specific proteins on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19, and are more likely to miss an active infection compared to molecular tests. Antigen tests require repeat testing to confirm negative test results.\n\nWhile molecular tests are currently considered the most reliable way to detect if someone has an active infection, there can be differences among the different types of molecular tests. For example, newer rapid diagnostic tests can provide results in less than an hour, compared to how most RT-PCR molecular tests provide results in a few hours to a few days. These rapid diagnostic tests are currently not as accurate, however, and researchers are investigating potential issues with the accuracy of rapid diagnostic tests.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Research suggests that diagnostic testing is more accurate a few days after symptoms start, or around a week after exposure. Testing more than once can confirm negative results when appropriate, and when tests are available. During the wait for test results, it is essential for people who suspect they have COVID-19, or may have been exposed to COVID-19, to take precautions and self-isolate when possible. It is also important to consider what type of test is being used to check for a COVID-19 infection, as this will likely impact how accurate the test is and how long it will take to get results.\n\nMolecular tests are among the most accurate diagnostic tests currently available for detecting whether someone has an active COVID-19 infection. Molecular tests use methods such as RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) to detect genetic material from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in respiratory samples such as nose and throat swabs. As with any type of testing, it is possible to have inaccurate results with molecular tests. People tend to be most concerned about the consequences of a test saying that someone does not have an active infection, when in reality they do have an active infection (known as a false negative). A false negative could make it difficult to reduce COVID-19 transmission, if the infected individual believes they are not infected and continues to expose others to infection. Additionally, a false negative could make it difficult to evaluate someone who may need treatment for COVID-19.\n\nMolecular tests have a higher risk of false negatives in the earliest days after exposure and symptom onset, according to an August 2020 publication in the Annals of Internal Medicine by researchers at John Hopkins University who reviewed 7 published studies on the performance of RT-PCR molecular tests. The researchers found that on average, the false negative rate was lowest around day 8 of an infection or 3 days after symptom onset (symptom onset is typically several days after an infection starts), with the false negative rate rising again as the infection continues. False negative test results in the early stages of infection are concerning, because other research (including studies published in Nature and the American Journal of Pathology) have found that COVID-19 patients can be most infectious to others in the early days of infection, when test results may be more likely to come back as false negatives.\n\nSome testing policies recommend that people get tested again to confirm a negative result. Repeat testing to confirm negative results can be particularly important for people who may interact with high-risk populations (ex. healthcare workers, caretakers), people who may interact with many others outside of their household (ex. an employee going back to the office, a student returning to in-person classes), and people who may need medical care for COVID-19 (e.g. elderly patients with underlying conditions).\n\nMolecular tests are a relatively accurate type of diagnostic testing, and they have a lower chance of false negatives when conducted a few days after symptoms start, or approximately a week after exposure. A lower chance of false negatives does not mean there is no chance of inaccurate test results, so repeat testing may be recommended to confirm test results in certain situations. With all the ongoing research and development work on COVID-19 tests, pandemic testing guidelines may continue to evolve.\n",

    ],
    "Background and context": "There are many new products being marketed to the public to help prevent, treat, and cure COVID-19. Unfortunately, many of these products are not backed by scientific evidence. \n\nTo prevent the spread of COVID-19, the World Health Organization (WHO), U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC), and other leading health organizations advise people to practice social distancing measures (maintaining at least 6 feet/2 meters from people), avoid large crowds especially indoors, practice frequent handwashing, and wear masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. \n\nScientists have said that cloth face masks may provide some protection for the mask wearers, and surgical or N95 masks provide even more protection. Masks should not be worn by infants and children under the age of two; people who are incapacitated, unconscious, or have trouble breathing; or people who would not be able to remove the mask without help. Masks with exhalation valves or vents should not be worn to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n",
    "What our experts say": "There is no scientific evidence that products marketed as “virus shut-out” (i.e. masks, cards, tags) prevent, treat or cure COVID-19 infection. In a search of medical and scientific literature, there were no search results or studies that mentioned “virus shut-out” masks. \n\nBased on the Virus Shut-Out Tag Facebook page and a search of \"virus shut-out\" website information, the primary product being promoted is the “virus shut-out” tag for wearing around one's neck. that will reportedly “reduce the 90% risk of being infected by continuously sending out the lowest concentration of chlorine dioxide.” \n\nThe Virus Shut-Out Tag Facebook page states that the cards “are not specifically made for COVID-19 and there’s no approved therapeutic claims.” The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states that the product is not registered with the EPA and “its safety and efficacy against viruses have not been evaluated.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) website states that the alleged active property, chlorine dioxide, is toxic and can be dangerous with long term or frequent exposure.\n\nOn the Virus Shut-Out Tag Facebook page, the “virus shut-out” tag is promoted to be used “with masks for better and stronger protection.” It is not clear if the masks on the company website are medical grade or provide protection above and beyond what cloth face masks provide.\n",

    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "Africa "
    ],
    "Background and context": "Many school districts are deciding whether or not to reopen schools, switch to online or distance learning, postpone opening until later in the year, or use strategies that involve some combination of these options. One of the biggest considerations these school systems face is how to protect teachers and students from getting infected with or spreading COVID-19 to others. The most effective strategy to prevent widespread infections in schools is distance learning, but this poses many challenges to school districts, teachers, families, and students. The U.S. CDC states that in-person learning \"is in the best interest of students, when compared to virtual learning,\" so this is not the optimal way to teach or learn. \n\nTeachers, families, and school districts must compare the benefits of in-person schooling against the risks posed by the COVID-19 spread. Many teachers and families are concerned about the risks involved with putting their lives and family members at risk of becoming infected should they return to schools. Ultimately, the decision of how to teach students is up to each school system and family, but teachers may want to consider their individual risks and the policies their schools are taking to prevent becoming infected with the virus.\n\nThe fact that children with COVID-19 are less likely to have severe symptoms or have asymptomatic infections than adults may help make their families more comfortable with sending them back to school in-person. But regardless of their roles, all people returning to schools soon should use as many prevention tools as possible from wearing masks in public spaces to rigorously washing hands with soap and water to distancing between people as much as possible. \n",
    "What our experts say": "This question can only truly be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, as there are many different points that have to be considered. Variables include: \n\n- Where schools are located (major cities, rural areas, small towns, etc.)\n- How many children are in each classroom\n- How many students and teachers are wearing masks all day\n- How much distance is between desks\n- How many other people live with teachers in their homes\n- If the school is located in a place with a virus outbreak\n- Individual behaviors like taking public transportation, social distancing and mask wearing\n\nIn addition to the individual risks each teacher faces, schools pose additional risks due to the high number of students who are in close contact with one another in closed, tight rooms. This can make prevention tools like social distancing and frequent hand washing difficult. It is also why it is important for school systems that are reopening, or have already reopened, to create safe, healthy spaces for students and teachers with policies like mandatory mask wearing, allowing for six feet/two meters of distance between desks, routine testing (if possible), using proper ventilation, consistent and frequent cleaning and decontamination of surfaces, installing physical barriers, and avoiding group transportation. \n\nKeeping both students and teachers safe in schools and communities depends on the behaviors, environments, underlying risk factors, and choices made by school systems and individuals. This is why it is not possible to accurately estimate where teachers are more likely to get infected with COVID-19, but shows why it is so critical to prevent the spread of the virus in all environments.\n\n",

      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Due to requirements and recommendations that people wear face masks in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, many news outlets have been reporting the potential for negative health outcomes related to wearing masks. There are very few health risks when it comes to this prevention measure, and masks are recommended for the majority of the population. However, one of the issues being widely discussed in international media is the potential for staph infections to occur due to face masks irritating and chafing the skin, causing a cut or wound. Staph infections can only occur through a skin opening, so while this concern is a valid one, it is highly unlikely to occur.\n\nMany of the health concerns related to face masks are very low risk, including staph infections, breathing difficulties, and allergies. In order to prevent any illness from occurring related to wearing a mask, it is important to speak to your doctor about any medical concerns you might have. It is also important to practice cleaning your face and mask, washing your hands rigorously with soap and water, and maintaining distance between yourself and others.\n",
    "What our experts say": "It is very rare for a person wearing a mask to develop a staph infection as a result of the mask. Staphylococcus aureus, also known as a 'staph infection,' is a germ that can be found on people's skin, and can potentially cause serious infections if it enters the bloodstream. \n\nUsually staph infections are minor and can be treated with antibiotics, but more severe infections can be worrisome. In order to develop a staph infection, the person wearing the mask would have to have an open lesion or untreated wound on their face, but even then, it very rarely happens. \n\nSome of the same prevention tips health organizations recommend for preventing COVID-19 infections can help prevent staph infections, like washing your hands rigorously, cleaning and bandaging wounds on your skin, and regularly cleaning your mask. Wearing moisturizers like lotion can also help protect your skin from irritation which could lead to an open wound, if the skin becomes raw. Though cases of staph infections related to mask wearing are very rare, it is important to take prevention measures seriously to avoid a potential infection.\n",

    "Question": "What do we know about pregnant women and COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background and context": "While pregnant women might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease, there is no data yet to show any pre-term complications. Since it is possible for pregnant women to transmit the virus to a newborn, it is common to test pregnant women pre-labor for the novel coronavirus. It is unknown if the virus is spread before, during, or after birth. \n\nThere have been documented cases of mistreatment, abuse, and obstetric violence of pregnant women globally in the context of COVID-19. Examples include limited prenatal care, lack of choice around who is in the delivery room, separation from newborns, and verbal abuse. The World Health Organization has issued guidance on pregnancy and COVID-19 aiming to address these concerns by discouraging negative actions such as newborn separation and forced cesarean sections.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 11, 2020._\n",
    "What our experts say": "Pregnancy increases the risk for severe COVID-19 disease, meaning there is a higher chance a pregnant person who becomes infected with the coronavirus will require hospitalization and suffer more serious symptoms of the disease. Preterm birth and other birth-related complications have not been associated with COVID-19, according to the studies completed and available at this time. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) encourages people to take preventive measures while pregnant and to seek prenatal care throughout pregnancy. If a person is infectious during labor, it is possible for them to spread the virus to the baby.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 20, 2020._\n",

    "Source of the question": [

    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Many nations have reached a point of being able to loosen some pandemic restrictions, like sheltering in place and avoiding gatherings. Governments have considered ways to prevent another rise in COVID-19 cases and one of the most talked about tools is widespread testing for infected individuals. While testing is usually done on patients who have symptoms of the virus, have been exposed to people infected with the virus, or who are at high risk of catching the virus, monitoring entire populations for any potential outbreaks is a strategy that many nations are considering. \n\nAssurance testing is a form of surveillance testing, but instead of tracking at-risk groups, they track an entire region to make sure new cases aren't happening. Since it is currently presumed that many cases of COVID-19 are spread by individuals who do not experience any symptoms, this type of testing could help find cases that would not be detected by prioritizing only those with symptoms. \n\nThis type of testing would also give public health groups the data to more accurately target areas with small outbreaks quickly, in order to isolate patients and complete contact tracing to inform others about their exposure to infected people.\n\nIt is not known what testing strategy many nations and regions will use to monitor COVID-19 cases, but assurance testing has strong potential for its ability to keep large populations safer as  economies and societies reopen.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Assurance testing, also called 'universal testing,' is a process in which an entire population gets tested for a virus several times over a specific period. So far during the pandemic, testing has mostly been saved for people who are experiencing symptoms, people who were in contact with individuals who tested positive for COVID-19, or people who are at high-risk of infection. Assurance testing would remove those limitations and allow everyone to get tested. \n\nAssurance testing tests large regions so that if an outbreak happens, it can be caught early and controlled through isolation measures. This type of testing could help different regions as they begin to reopen economies, schools, and other large gatherings after the lifting of lockdown and shelter in place orders. \n\nAssurance testing can help people interact with one another safely without leading to an increase in cases and uncontrollable outbreaks. Social distancing and mask wearing are still recommended in most regions for the near future, but assurance testing could help to maintain lower levels of the virus in populations that have been able to reopen.\n\n\n",

      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Monoclonal antibodies have been trending in the news during the COVID-19 pandemic, and also previously for cancer drugs and other applications. Monoclonal antibodies are typically produced in a lab through cloning, to act as antibodies which are proteins made by the body to fight infections. \n\nMonoclonal antibodies have the potential to be produced with consistent quality and purity at a large scale. Additionally, monoclonal antibodies have the potential to provide therapeutic benefits to the immune system because they are highly selective in how they bond to specific foreign invaders that cause disease.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies were first developed in the 1970s, and later Georges Köhler and César Milstein received the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine for developing a key way to produce monoclonal antibodies. Earlier, Paul Ehrlich and Élie Metchnikoff received the 1908 Nobel Prize for Physiology/Medicine for work that set the foundation for making compounds to selectively target a disease-causing organism. \n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 11, 2020._\n",
    "What our experts say": "Antibodies are tiny proteins created by the immune system to attach to any foreign invaders in the immune system (antigens) and also tell the immune system to begin defending itself from this threat. Monoclonal antibodies (which means 'one type of antibody') are antibodies created in a lab that can act as a replacement for the antibodies the body normally creates. The difference between these lab-made antibodies and those created by the immune system is that the monoclonal types are uniquely designed to target a specific antigen, in this case the virus that causes COVID-19, so it can send it messages, try to destroy it, and even make it easier for the immune system to find the antigen and attack it. Once the antigen is mapped out in the lab and scientists are able to produce monoclonal antibodies to attach to them, the lab then makes a large amount of these antibodies so they can help the immune system in its fight against a threat.\n\nCOVID-19 is unique because it is characterized by its spikes, which you can see under a microscope. Monoclonal antibodies created in the lab work by targeting and breaking these spikes on the virus, which are critical for the virus to enter our cells and infect us. There is growing interest in their potential for use in both vaccine development, but also treatment for infection. The hope is that these antibodies can work as both a vaccine to prevent infection, and/or as a therapeutic treatment to help reduce severity of illness in patients with COVID-19. It is likely that after rigorous testing for safety and effectiveness, these antibodies would be produced in labs, manufactured in large quantities, and they would be injected into people to prevent infection from the virus. As of now, no monoclonal antibody treatments have been approved for this use and are still being heavily researched.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 11, 2020._\n\n\n\n \n",

    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & immune system response",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "One of the reasons it can be difficult to understand how the immune system responds to the virus that causes COVID-19 (and all viruses) is because everyone's immune system is unique. After being infected, each of us produces different levels of antibodies -- these are proteins that attach to the antigens (any substance, usually a protein, that triggers your immune system to produce antibodies against it) and attack them. These differences can impact how long patients remain sick with COVID-19 and how severe their cases can be. A further complicating factor is that non-active parts of the virus can still cause your immune system to overreact, as if the virus is still reproducing in your body, when it isn't really doing that. \n\nInducing an immune response in our body is also a crucial component of vaccine development. A successful vaccine must produce antibodies to prepare our bodies to defend against the virus if we are exposed to it again in the future. The better a vaccine can mimic a natural infection, the better it will be able to trigger an immune reaction that mimics a natural immune response.\n",
    "What our experts say": "When our bodies are exposed to pathogens - tiny, foreign organisms such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, worms and other invaders - our natural defense called the 'immune system' tries to protect us and keep us healthy. When the body senses that the pathogen, in this case, COVID-19, is trying to get into the body through the nose, mouth, or eyes, it launches into the first part of this defense called the 'innate immune system.'\n\nA. Innate Immune System\n\nThis part of the immune system tries to prevent the virus from spreading and reproducing in our bodies, and from moving around in our bodies. The innate immune system is made up of several types of defenses, including the skin and body openings (like the mouth and nose); different white blood cells to defend our bodies from pathogens; and different substances in bodily fluids and the blood to try and stop the virus from reproducing. This system tries to prevent the virus from entering the body through the mouth, nose, and eyes, but if the virus does get inside a person, then white blood cells will move toward the virus' location and cause an increase in blood circulation there so it becomes hot and swollen while the body might also produce a fever (as high temperatures can sometimes kill pathogens).  At this point, other cells in the blood and tissue try to enclose the virus and eat the viral particles.\n\nBut if after four to seven days, the innate immune system is not able to kill all of the virus and the virus causes an infection, the adaptive immune system will begin to defend the body.\n\nB. Adaptive Immune System\n\nThe adaptive immune response, also called the acquired immune system, is a much more focused effort to target and destroy the foreign threat: the virus. Two important parts of the adaptive immune system are white blood cells called B cells and T cells. B cells create antibodies - small proteins that attach** **to unique parts of each pathogen called 'antigens'. When your body senses a particular antigen attached to the virus in the body, B cells then creates antibodies that can connect to those antigens using a specific shape that was created to match it. \n\nMeanwhile, T cells try to kill the antigen like an army fighting off an invader. Some T cells also help B cells make antibodies while others are busy working to stop the virus from reproducing in your body and spreading to different parts of your body. This part of the adaptive immune response also creates longer term memory of the virus that will help it fight off the virus if it is exposed to it again in the future, and to launch its defenses more quickly. Researchers are now studying how long-term this memory-based immunity lasts and how strong it is in defending against COVID-19 infection in the future.\n\nC. Conclusion\nHopefully at this point, the innate and adaptive immune systems are able to kill the virus and create some immunity to it. If not, the immune system continues working to fight off the virus, but symptoms might worsen as the body weakens after spending so much energy to fight off the virus. In some cases, COVID-19 might impact organs so severely that it can result in death.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Background and context": "While COVID-19 diagnostic tests determine whether or not a person is currently infected with the virus, antibody tests are used to determine whether or not a person was infected with COVID-19 in the past. This occurs through a process in the immune system whereby the body develops a type of protein called  'antibodies' in response to the presence of a foreign object threatening the body, also called an \"antigen\", which in this case is the virus. The antibodies latch onto antigens and then work to remove them from the body. Antibodies are detected in the blood of people who are tested after infection; they show the body’s efforts to fight off a specific infection. This is why antibody tests can determine whether or not a person has had a specific virus.\n \nIn comparison, tests for active cases of the virus (such as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test) looks for the actual genes of the virus itself in a person. This means that COVID-19 has to be active and have a large enough amount infecting in a person in order for the test to be accurate. One difference between these tests is the fact that antibody tests look for prior infection from a virus using blood, whereas PCR-based tests are run on saliva or mucus samples to look for the virus's genetic material and diagnose people who are currently infected with the novel coronavirus. \n\nEach tests have different levels of of specificity (how well a test identifies patients who do not have a disease) and sensitivity (how well a test identifies patients who do have a disease), and each have different ideal standards. \n\nFor instance, while with antibody tests the key metric is specificity, with diagnostic tests, the key metric is sensitivity. This is because an individual with a false negative test result may be mistakenly reassured that they are safe (just as one would with a false positive antibody test), and in turn pay less attention to basic prevention (e.g., social distancing).\n",
    "What our experts say": "Antibody tests are now available in many parts of the world, and they can play an important role in understanding COVID-19 trends and identifying groups at higher risk for infection. \nDiagnostic tests are never 100% accurate. Sometimes, a test will produce false positives (when you test positive for the virus, but don't have it) and false negatives (when you test negative for the virus, but you really have been infected). The antibody tests for COVID-19 are similar. To be able to trust the results of an antibody test, we must look at its ability to detect the presence of COVID-19 antibodies when they are present, and its ability to confirm the absence COVID-19 antibodies when they are truly absent. \nIn the context of the current pandemic, it is important for us to reduce the amount of false positive test results that can occur by choosing a test that is highly specific. This means we must choose a test whose ability to correctly identify those without the disease is as accurate as possible, so that a negative test result truly means that person has not been infected with COVID-19. This is because an individual with a false positive test result may be mistakenly reassured that they are safe, and may pay less attention to basic prevention (e.g., social distancing). In this context, the U.S. CDC recommends choosing a test with very high specificity, perhaps 99.5% or greater. Irrespective of where people reside, they should choose the test available on the market with the highest specificity. However, it is important to note that at this stage of the pandemic, we don't know yet exactly what a positive antibody test means in practice. We are not sure yet if a positive antibody test means that the antibodies will give the person immunity (i.e. prevent them from getting sick again with COVID-19); and if they do, how long this protection can last (weeks? months?). Several studies are currently underway. \n",

    "Question": "What do we know so far about face masks and their ability to prevent COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & masks",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Partner Organization"
    ],
    "Background and context": "There has been a lot of debate about how effective wearing face masks are in preventing the transmission of COVID-19. Part of the reason for this is the confusion that occurred in February and March of 2020 when the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) advised the public not to wear masks. This guidance was based on several important points: \n\n1) These agencies did not think there was enough proof that the general public should be wearing masks unless they were infected with COVID-19 or they were around people infected with  COVID-19. This is because it wasn't known yet that people could still spread COVID-19 even if they had no symptoms;\n2) There was a shortage of masks for doctors and healthcare professionals ; \n3) The difference in the types of masks and materials that were available; and\n4) The research that is still in progress about how COVID-19 spreads (like through droplets, surfaces, etc.). \n\nHowever, the research has evolved since the beginning of the pandemic, and we now have enough proof that masks are effective at preventing the spread of COVID-19. This is why once the international scientific community had reached that consensus, the WHO, the U.S. CDC, and other health organizations changed their recommendations and now advise people to wear masks while in public settings. \nIt is common to change policies as new information becomes available. Because COVID-19 is a new virus, we are still learning more every day and changing and improving our recommendations.\n",
    "What our experts say": "As per the World Health Organization (WHO), wearing masks is part of an overall strategy to suppress the transmission of COVID-19, along with maintaining at least 2 meters (6 feet) distance and frequently washing your hands. \n\nThere are generally two kinds of face masks that are available - medical (or surgical) masks and non-medical (or fabric) masks. Medical masks can protect people from getting infected as well as prevent the spread from those that are infected. Therefore, WHO recommends medical masks to be worn by health workers, care givers of patients infected with COVID-19, anyone who has mild symptoms of COVID-19, people with other health conditions which make them more susceptible to COVID-19, as well as people who are 60 years or older because they have a higher risk of getting infected with COVID-19.\n\nWHO advises that non-medical masks should be worn in areas where there is high transmission of COVID-19, crowded places where at least 2 meters (6 feet) physical distancing is not possible, on public transport, in shops and other closed areas. COVID-19 can be spread by people without symptoms, as they may not know that they are infected but are equally capable of spreading the virus. Hence, masks should be worn in public settings.\n \nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (U.S. CDC) suggests that masks with exhalation valves or vents will not help prevent the spread of COVID-19 from the person wearing such a mask to others, therefore these masks should not be used for that purpose.\nWearing a face mask protects others from you when you cough, sneeze, talk, or just breathe, particularly indoors or when standing close to someone. Masks also partially protect the wearer from inhaling the virus from other people nearby, and prevents people from touching their mouth and nose.\nMask wearing is a fundamental element of pandemic response for respiratory illnesses because masks act as a physical barrier from the release of infectious respiratory droplets that may come from your mouth or nose when you speak, sing, sneeze or cough. \nIn addition to social distancing measures (maintaining 6 feet or 2 meters between people), face masks are recommended to prevent the spread of COVID-19, even in hot climates. There is no evidence that surgical masks or cloth masks lower oxygen levels at all. It is important to use a mask that allows you to breathe comfortably while talking and walking and that fits well on your face. \nFor safety, masks should not be worn by children under the age of 2, by people who have trouble breathing, or anyone who is unconscious or unable to remove the mask without assistance. \nWe do not know yet if face shields alone provide enough protection against COVID-19. Currently, face shields are not recommended as an alternative to face masks. Ideally, face shields should be used in combination with face masks. \n\nThis entry was updated with new information on Aug 13, 2020\n",

    "Category": "On: COVID-19 & asymptomatic carriers",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Background and context": "There is concern about transmission by people without symptoms because this makes disease prevention more challenging. For example, while it is a helpful public health measure to recommend that people self-isolate when ill, it is insufficient to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. This is because if someone never develops symptoms, or who has not yet developed symptoms, they can still infect others.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Asymptomatic people are those that do not show any symptoms but have been infected with COVID-19. As per a recent study published in the medical journal, JAMA, asymptomatic people have similar amounts of virus as symptomatic people and are capable of spreading the virus as much. Because asymptomatic people may not know that they are infected, they may not isolate themselves and that way can spread the virus even more.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) has revised its current best estimate and now advises that it estimates 40% of people infected with COVID-19 are asymptomatic. The World Health Organization has yet to provide an official estimate and noted that it will vary across populations.\nSome studies have noted that asymptomatic carriers might be the biggest spreaders of COVID-19 in certain populations. There is also evidence to suggest that pre-symptomatic people infected with COVID-19  - people who eventually develop symptoms but haven't had any yet - spread the most amount of virus in the time before they have symptoms.\nThis is why it is very important that everyone wear masks, wash their hands vigorously for 20 seconds, and maintain a distance of six feet (2 meters) between themselves and others. \n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 13, 2020_\n",

    "Question": "Does exhaled carbon dioxide in a mask cause any side effects?",
    "Status": "In progress",
    "Background and context": "The claim that the prolonged use of face masks can cause oxygen deficiency, carbon dioxide intoxication, dizziness, or other health challenges is not grounded in science. There is no evidence that surgical masks or cloth masks cause significant build-up of carbon dioxide or deficiency of oxygen. This information has been primarily circulating on social media among individuals or communities resistant to mask-wearing in general. While masks are restrictive and can feel like they impede air flow, properly designed masks do allow air flow by design, and the feeling of inconvenience or minor discomfort does not equate to health risks such as a build-up of carbon dioxide. Inhaling high amounts of carbon dioxide can be dangerous and lead to hypercapnia (carbon dioxide toxicity), but is extremely unlikely to happen as a result of wearing a mask.\n\nThere is some evidence that prolonged use of N95 masks in wearers with particularly severe health conditions, such as lung disease, could cause some build-up of carbon dioxide in the body. However, these cases are rare, and the use of N95 masks is not recommended for the general public in order to reserve them for frontline workers who are at higher risk of exposure to the virus. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Exhaled carbon dioxide caused by the use of face masks, including the N95 mask, has not been shown to cause carbon dioxide toxicity or lack of adequate oxygen in healthy people. Because the masks we make and purchase, and even the airtight medical masks listed above, are designed for constant breathing, the risks of any side effects are low. Again, for people diagnosed with illnesses such as COPD, emphysema, and obesity, and in heavy smokers, the consistent use of N95-like masks over long periods of time could cause some build-up of carbon dioxide levels in the body. If people in this group are experiencing these side effects, they should speak to their doctor.\n",

    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & testing",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "COVID-19 access to viral testing (diagnostic tests that tell you if you are currently infected with the virus) has varied significantly during the course of the pandemic. In the US, testing was largely unavailable except for those with acute symptoms until recent months. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), specimens tested by both the CDC and public health labs multiplied by more than 12 times from the beginning of March to the beginning of May. Limited testing early in the pandemic has left gaps in the data, particularly with regards to asymptomatic cases; however, because testing was initially (and in some regions still is) limited, there has been confusion about the benefits. While viral testing is not perfect in terms of accuracy and will not alone slow the pandemic, it is a crucial piece of the response effort. If one can get regularly tested, one should. In the initial months of the pandemic, countries that rapidly scaled up viral testing capacity, such as South Korea, were able to better contain the spread of COVID-19 in comparison to countries that were slow to increase testing, such as the United States. \n\nSerology (antibody) testing has also varied in availability and recommended uptake since the onset of the pandemic. There has been less of an urgent push for serology testing because it does not tell you if you are currently infected and there is lacking evidence on how protective the antibodies are and their length of protection. Additionally, there is a chance that a positive result could be due to antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same coronavirus family (eg. the one that causes the common cold). The U.S. CDC has also issued warnings about the risk of high false positive rates in antibody tests. While antibody tests are an integral part of routine surveillance and particularly understanding disease prevalence and the frequency of asymptomatic infection, they should not be seen as a silver bullet to virus control. \n\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "Testing provides several benefits during a pandemic, including early diagnosis, contact tracing, prevention, and surveillance. Viral testing identifies if an individual is currently infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. At the individual level, it allows infected individuals who were potentially experiencing symptoms to be diagnosed and access the care they need. At the community level, viral testing prevents further infections since an infected individual can take all necessary precautions to not infect other people. It also allows public health experts to identify new cases and track the spread of the virus through contact tracing by following the chain of transmission. Viral testing is commonly used to test people who have symptoms of COVID-19 as well as caregivers, essential workers, travelers, and others who may not show active symptoms. \n\nSerology tests - also called antibody tests - are useful to find out if an individual has been previously infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. These kinds of tests look for antibodies in the blood, which determine if there was a previous infection. It allows public health experts to find out how many COVID-19 infections have occurred in the past, and to track what percentage of the population has been infected over time, which has important implications for surveillance. At a policy level, serology testing can guide social distancing or quarantine guidelines. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control use a serology surveillance strategy to better understand the spread of the virus by testing in different locations, at different points of time, and within different populations (ex. across age, ethnic and socioeconomic groups) in the United States. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the evidence surrounding serology testing and its link to immunity (protection) is still evolving. We do not understand fully if prior infection is evidence of immunity, know how long antibodies can protect the body, or whether patients can get infected again after a previous infection. \n",

    "Question": "What do we know about the association between blood type and severe reaction to COVID-19",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background and context": "The media is now reporting on how more recent studies found that blood type is not linked to risks of intubation or death from COVID-19, after adjusting for other factors like age and gender identity. Furthermore, it is important to note that Type O blood does not mean immunity to COVID-19.\n\n_Updated:_ _July 27, 2020: Please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, where scientists are continuing to learn more and release new publications. The latest and most accurate answer can be found above._\n",
    "What our experts say": "As of now, there is not enough evidence to indicate whether or not there may be some connection between blood type and COVID-19 risk, though the link is likely to be minimal if it does exist. Studies previously cited in the news suggested that Type A blood could be associated with higher risks of severe cases of COVID-19, included studies that had not yet been assessed by scientific experts (referred to in science as the peer-review process). One of these recent studies had been peer-reviewed and published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM); however it used genes to determine the blood type, which is a method that is not very accurate.  \n\nTwo more recent studies from Columbia University and Massachusetts General Hospital in the U.S. found that blood type is not associated with risks of intubation or death from COVID-19, after adjusting for other factors. While scientists continue to learn more, age and underlying health conditions remain more significant risk factors for severe COVID-19 symptoms, and Type A blood is not thought to be a major risk factor at this time. \n\nWhile some studies have suggested a potential risk reduction for people with Type O blood, not all the studies have been peer-reviewed and the use of blood donors as study participants can give the appearance of Type O being more protective than it is (Type O blood is over-represented in blood donors, compared to the general population). Type O blood does not mean immunity to COVID-19.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on July 27, 2020._\n",

    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "Senegal"
    ],
    "Background and context": "New policies around the world require people to wear masks. The point of these rules is to prevent the spread of COVID-19 between people when they speak, laugh, cough or sneeze. However, the more rules requiring mask wearing are established, the more false claims about the dangers of masks wearing circulate on social media. There is now substantial scientific evidence supporting mask wearing. The evidence shows that face masks are safe, do not cause suffocation or difficulty breathing if worn correctly, and should be worn by most people. For special groups like children under the age of two or people who struggle to breathe in general, they should speak to their doctors about how to protect themselves from the virus if they are unable to wear masks. The World Health Organization suggests all non-healthcare professionals wear cloth masks, maintain your distance from others, and wash your hands frequently to prevent spreading or becoming infected with COVID-19.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 11, 2020._\n",
    "What our experts say": "Masks may cause an increase in your body temperature, but there is no evidence to suggest that cloth masks will cause suffocation (a struggle to breathe or get enough oxygen). In addition to social distancing measures, cloth masks are recommended for the general public to prevent the spread of COVID-19, even in hot climates. It is important to use a fabric mask that allows you to breathe comfortably while talking and walking. For safety, masks should not be worn by children under the age of two, by people who have trouble breathing, or anyone who is unconscious or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. It is not known if face shields alone provide protection against COVID-19, and they are not recommended as an alternative to face masks.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 11, 2020._\n",

    "Status": "Published",

    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "India"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Bro-Zedex is a liquid medication that may be used to treat cough symptoms by thinning mucous and decreasing swelling so that people can breathe easier. Both formulas are made of a combination of bromhexine, guaifenesin, menthol, and terbutaline. There is little research available about this medication, but similar medicines are being tested to see if they may help people manage symptoms of COVID-19.  \n\nThe first listed ingredient, bromhexine, is not available in the U.S. and is labeled only for animal use in some other countries. In places where it is approved, bromhexine is used to treat chest congestion by breaking down mucous and making it easier to cough the mucous out. The other ingredients are commonly used either alone or in combination with other medications. Guaifenesin is used to help cough up mucous and clear it from the chest and is found in many non-prescription cold and cough medicines. Menthol is used to help decrease coughing and is commonly an ingredient in non-prescription lozenges. Terbutaline is commonly used to help open airways to help people breathe more easily; it is usually only available with a prescription.\n \nSide effects common to Bro-Zedex include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, sweating, increased heart rate, tiredness, headache, and tremors. While side effects usually go away once the medication is stopped, contact your doctor if you experience these or other concerning side effects. Taking this medication for a long time or in large doses may be harmful. In addition, there are many interactions between common prescription and non-prescription medications and the medications in Bro-Zedex. If you are taking other medications, you should talk to your brother before taking Bro-Zedex.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 11, 2020._\n",
    "What our experts say": "Bro-Zedex is a cough syrup that is used to treat symptoms of a cough. There are Bro-Zedex formulas for both wet and dry coughs, and the ingredients in each type are different. For wet coughs, the key ingredient in the orange-colored Bro-Zedex is bromhexine, which is a medication that treats respiratory issues that cause excessive mucus and phlegm in the throat and mouth. Bromhexine does this by making the mucus in the throat thinner and easier to remove through coughing. This formula's other ingredients - menthol, guaifenesin, and terbutaline - can make the phlegm in your chest and throat thinner so it's easier to cough up, cool and soothe sore throats, and relax the muscles in your airways. For dry coughs, Bro-Zedex comes in a green liquid and its main ingredients are ambroxol, levosalbutamol, and guaifenesin. This formula loosens congestion in your chest and throat by breaking up phlegm and also relaxing the muscles in your airway so you can breathe easier. Though these formulas work in similar ways, their ingredients are meant to relieve specific symptoms that come with wet and dry coughs.\n\nBro-Zedex is not used as a treatment for COVID-19 on its own, but may help relieve some of the uncomfortable symptoms that occur in mild to moderate cases of the infection, like coughing and phlegm build-up. Current research is looking at whether bromhexine can be taken for prevention - before a COVID-19 infection to prevent someone from getting sick, or as part of a treatment plan in more severe cases to help improve some symptoms. Bro-Zedex is also part of clinical trials where researchers are looking to see if it can shorten the amount of time a person has COVID-19 symptoms or help prevent hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19 from becoming infected with other respiratory illnesses while they are still in the hospital.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 11, 2020._\n",

    "Question": "Should people with asthma wear face masks? ",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background and context": "Public health organizations around the world recommend the use of masks and face coverings. There are some exceptions, such as for children under 2 years of age and people with medical conditions that can make it difficult to breathe through a mask. However, people with asthma have generally not been included as one of these exceptions.\n\nIn fact, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that having moderate-to-severe asthma may increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and recommend that people with asthma avoid potential triggers for their condition, keep a 30-day supply of necessary medications (ex. inhalers), and consult their doctor regarding any concerns about their condition. For cleaning of indoor spaces with disinfectants, people with asthma can request assistance and make sure they are not in the room during cleaning. People with asthma should continue following guidelines when possible for using masks in public, in combination with social distancing and hand washing.\n\nThe American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology provides additional information about the use of masks for people with asthma: \"There is no evidence that wearing a face mask makes asthma worse. However, it is possible that some people with asthma may feel it is more difficult to get an adequate breath while wearing a face mask. While we support and advocate that people follow U.S. CDC recommendations, some people with asthma do not feel they can breathe adequately while wearing a mask...If you feel you can only wear a mask for a short time, plan for any necessary outings to public places to be as short as possible and to wear your mask as long as possible. It may be helpful to try different face coverings at home to find one that is most comfortable, and practice wearing the mask at home for a period before your next outing. Always use a clean mask for each outing.\"\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 11, 2020._\n",
    "What our experts say": "People with asthma should wear face masks. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) note that people with moderate to severe asthma might have an increased risk of severe case of COVID-19. Therefore, wearing a mask is an important way to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nStudies also show that wearing a mask does not reduce oxygen levels and should not make breathing more difficult. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of face masks in public and when social distancing is not possible, and it is safe for people with asthma to wear a mask for as long as needed. People who feel it is difficult to breathe adequately with a mask ca, for example, try to limit the length of their outings requiring mask use. However, every patient is different and if you have been diagnosed with asthma, have a severe case, have difficulty breathing normally, or have difficulty breathing with a mask, you should speak with your doctor about options for protecting yourself and others from COVID-19. \n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 11, 2020._\n",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Partner Organization"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "Nigeria"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Disinfection tunnels (also known as sanitizing tunnels) are being installed in several locations around the world, with widespread media coverage and claims that they can safely prevent the transmission of COVID-19. However, there is no scientific evidence showing that the use of disinfection tunnels is safe or effective for preventing COVID-19 transmission. \n\nOne of the earliest installations of a disinfection tunnel during the COVID-19 pandemic was in an industrial complex in China. There are now installations around the world attempting to disinfect people while crossing borders or entering healthcare facilities, office buildings, sports stadiums, banks, supermarkets, and even schools. There have been public outcries about the dangers of these disinfection tunnels, particularly following their use on migrants and school children. \n\nAdditionally, the WHO warns that the use of chemical disinfectants (such as chlorine) in disinfection tunnels can take away from the supply needed for other important interventions, such as treating drinking water and cleaning healthcare facilities. Researchers have also raised concerns about the financial costs of disinfection tunnels, which can channel economic resources away from other pandemic response and recovery initiatives.\n",
    "What our experts say": "The World Health Organization (WHO) and other international health agencies do not recommend using disinfection tunnels to prevent transmission of COVID-19. This is due to concerns about their safety and effectiveness. \n\nDisinfection tunnels are spaces (such as a tunnel, room, cubicle, or cabinet) in which people are sprayed with chemical disinfectants or exposed to other disinfection methods, such as ultraviolet (UV) light. \n\nThese disinfection methods are often applied to the surfaces of objects. Their use directly on people can be dangerous to human health and may not stop the transmission of COVID-19. \n\nIf a person is infected with COVID-19 and passes through a disinfection tunnel, any disinfection would only be external and the infected person could still exhale droplets (by breathing, speaking, coughing, sneezing, etc.) that could transmit COVID-19 to others.\n\nPeople passing through disinfection tunnels can experience physical as well as psychological harm. Chemical disinfectants sometimes used in these tunnels can be toxic to the human body, leading to irritation or damage of the eyes, skin, lungs, and gastrointestinal system (for example nausea or vomiting). Some chemical disinfectants are flammable and explosive, generate toxic gases, and are harmful to the environment. UV light exposure, which is also sometimes used in disinfection tunnels, can lead to skin burns, skin cancer, and eye damage. The International Ultraviolet Association (IUVA) states: \"there are no protocols to advise or to permit the safe use of UV light directly on the human body at the wavelengths and exposures proven to efficiently kill viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.\" Psychologically, the pain and stress of passing through a disinfection tunnel can be traumatic.\n\nPreventative measures (such as physical distancing, hand washing, wearing masks, and ensuring good ventilation) are recommended to help reduce the transmission of COVID-19, but disinfection tunnels are not recommended as a COVID-19 preventative measure. \n",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Most disease-causing agents, such as viruses and bacteria, stay within one host species, with many barriers preventing a jump from animals to humans. When a disease does break down the barriers between animals and people, it’s called a zoonotic disease. It's rare to have that jump result in a global outbreak, but even more rare to result in a global pandemic, as we're experiencing now. These jumps are becoming more commonplace, likely due to climate change. According to Margaret Wild, an expert in wildlife diseases and a professor at Washington State University in the U.S., “These diseases don’t transmit to humans often, and when they do, it’s typically when we push natural systems by destroying animal habitat or crowding different species together with people in a marketplace.” \n",
    "What our experts say": "While scientists have hypothesized that COVID-19 came from snakes, pangolins, bats, and other creatures, we still don't know exactly which animal passed the virus to humans, or how many species it might have impacted along the way. Scientists have determined that the virus did come from animals, not humans, and was first traced to a wet market in Wuhan, China. Many countries are hoping an independent investigation will take place to determine when and how COVID-19 first entered the human population, and at exactly what location. Many experts believe that the virus is a \"wild\" one, meaning that one animal species transmitted the virus to another species before it was spread to humans. The only way to determine exactly which animal the virus came from is to find the original animal species in the wild.\n",

    "Question": "Are there any side effects of using hand sanitizer?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background and context": "The virus causing COVID-19 can spread from touching an infected surface, from exposure to respiratory droplets, and from airborne transmission. Person-to-person spread (i.e. not from touching surfaces) is the most well understood form of transmission, as well as the main transmission route for COVID-19. Hand sanitizer is one way to clean your hands after touching surfaces and/or interacting with people, particularly when hand-washing is not an option. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) recommends soap and water for hand hygiene whenever possible and especially during cooking, after using the restroom, before eating, and when hands are visibly soiled. When using hand sanitizer, it is important to rub it over the entire surface of hands until dry.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Side-effects of hand sanitizer are short-term and often mild. The side effects are usually related to skin irritation, like cracking and bleeding, due to either irritation from the product or overuse and drying of the skin. It is important to always check the label to ensure safe use. Ingestion or use around the eyes and nose can cause irritation. \n\nAlcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol to be effective. Hand sanitizer is a good way to clean hands when soap and water isn't available and is effective against the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently issued a warning on the increase in hand sanitizer products containing methanol, instead of ethanol. Methanol, or wood alcohol, is a toxic substance when absorbed through the skin or when ingested that can lead to blindness, hospitalizations, or death. On August 5, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 4 deaths and 3 patients with visual impairments from drinking hand sanitizer. The FDA has recalled over 135 hand sanitizer products for safety reasons, and also warns against false labels claiming a hand sanitizer product is \"FDA-approved\" (because the FDA has not and does not approve any hand sanitizer products). Hand sanitizer products should be stored out of the reach of children to help prevent accidental ingestion. If you become exposed to hand sanitizer containing methanol and are experiencing symptoms, seek immediate treatment for potential reversal of methanol poisoning. \n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 10, 2020._\n",

    "Question": "Can the virus be transmitted through the air?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Transmission",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & aerosol transmission",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Respiratory droplets are little beads of liquids that fly out when a person sneezes, coughs, or uses their mouth. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that COVID-19 mainly spreads from person to person through these droplets when people come in close contact with one another. Airborne particles tend to be lighter than respiratory droplets and can stay in the air for longer periods of time, which makes airborne viruses even easier to spread. Some studies have shown that COVID-19 could potentially be spread through the air in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. The evidence on this mode of transmission is still evolving.\n\nAirborne transmission of COVID-19 is trending in the news, in part because 239 scientists signed an open letter on July 6, 2020 urging the WHO to update its COVID-19 guidance in response to growing evidence that airborne transmission is possible, ranging from case reports to epidemiological studies. The WHO has since acknowledged the emerging evidence for airborne transmission in \"crowded, closed, poorly ventilated settings,\" while cautioning that the evidence is preliminary and should be assessed further. If airborne transmission of COVID-19 is significant, this has major implications for containment efforts (ex. masks may be needed indoors and in socially-distant settings, ventilation systems may need to minimize recirculating air and find ways to filter or disinfect contaminated air, etc.).\n",
    "What our experts say": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus that causes COVID-19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets (little spit droplets that fly out when a person sneezes, coughs or talks). Respiratory droplets can infect other people who are nearby, or indirectly infect others when they touch a surface contaminated with infected droplets. After an open letter by scientists in July 2020, the WHO now acknowledges the possibility of airborne transmission, which is caused by smaller and lighter 'droplet nuclei' (residuals of respiratory droplets from infected people) that can remain in the air for longer periods of time and remain infectious over long distances.\n\nExperts are looking at previous data from China to see whether the virus may spread through the air or through vents via airborne transmission. While a few lab-based studies have found that the virus can be present in the air for up to three hours, these studies did not assess if the virus is viable to infect anyone else. Recently, a research study published in Nature found viral contamination in air samples from patients isolated at a medical center, which supports the use of airborne isolation precautions in caring for COVID-19 cases. A few studies have also looked into how airborne transmission may have played a role in certain outbreaks, such as the one in the Diamond Princess cruise ship. One of these studies in pre-print found that it was likely that a combination of both close-range (respiratory droplet) transmission and long-range (airborne) transmission contributed similarly to disease progression aboard the ship.\n\nThus far, the WHO still claims that evidence points to close person-to-person respiratory droplet transmission as the primary mode of COVID-19 transmission. However, experts warn that there is significant reason to believe airborne transmission is happening. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now provides infection control recommendations for airborne transmission as well as respiratory droplet transmission. Definitive studies may take a long time to alter the body of evidence in the coming weeks and months, but proactive prevention measures such as universal use of masks could save lives in the meantime.  \n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 10, 2020._\n",

    "Question": "What do we know so far about nebulizer-inhaled steroids as a treatment or cure for COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Subcategory": "Steroid",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Partner Organization"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "In the U.S., a Texas doctor has been recently promoting the use of inhaled steroids such as budesonide to treat COVID-19, which has gained attention on social media. However, there have been no studies to show that inhaled steroids are beneficial in treating COVID-19. The doctor making these claims has also suggested that inhaled steroids are why countries like Taiwan have fewer COVID-19 deaths, but the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement provided to FactCheck.org that “there is no evidence suggesting that inhaled corticosteroid have reduced case fatality rate in Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, and Iceland.”\n\nRegarding steroids in general, recent studies have shown that the steroid dexamethasone may be effective in treating severe cases of COVID-19 when given orally or through an IV (intravenous). However, this same impact has not been demonstrated in patients with mild or moderate cases or when dexamethasone is administered through a nebulizer. It should be noted that giving steroids to patients who are not severely ill with COVID-19 might cause more harm than benefit as steroids are known to suppress the immune system rather than help it fight infections more strongly. Doctors have warned against off-label use and hoarding of drugs.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 10, 2020._\n",
    "What our experts say": "There are currently no clinical trials or observational studies on the use of inhaled steroids in COVID-19 patients. More research is needed before repurposing these drugs as a COVID-19 treatment. \n\nThere have been rumors circulating about using \"nebulizers\" to inhale steroids, such as the anti-inflammatory drug budesonide (brand name Pulmicort), to potentially treat COVID-19. \n\nInhaled steroids like budesonide can have side effects, and are also crucial for patients with health conditions who do not have COVID-19, so these should only be used when recommended by your doctor. Budesonide can be inhaled or taken orally, and when inhaled is part of a family of anti-inflammatory medications called inhaled steroids that are primarily used to help manage symptoms for conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Budesonide is a prescription-only drug that is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of COVID-19.\n\n\"Nebulizers\" are a type of inhaler that change liquid medications, like budesonide, into a mist that can be more easily inhaled into the lungs. Nebulizers can be more expensive than the most common type of inhaler used by people with asthma, and patients usually use nebulizers for specific reasons, such as if a child or someone with severe asthma is having difficulties inhaling medicine.\n",

    "Question": "Are air purifiers especially the mini, portable ones worn as necklaces effective in preventing transmission of COVID-19 or other coronaviruses?",
    "Status": "In progress",
    "Background and context": "Miniature, portable air purifiers are currently being advertised around the world, particularly in online marketplaces. Unfortunately, many claims made by these products around COVID-19 prevention are unverified. For products that claim to use high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which are physical filters designed to catch at least 99.7% of particulates that are 0.3 micrometers or larger in size, it is important to remember that the coronavirus particles causing COVID-19 are smaller on average than the 0.3 micrometer limit for HEPA filters. According to Pediatric Pulmonologist Dr. Nidhy Varghese, “even if these microbes make it into the purifier, they may elude filtration...the data so far suggests that it is unlikely that air purifiers will help with coronaviruses.\" The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also emphases that \"by itself, a portable air cleaner is not enough to protect people from COVID-19.\"\n",
    "What our experts say": "Mini, portable air purifier necklaces (such as the type available for purchase on consumer websites) have not been shown to prevent COVID-19 infection as there have been no studies about these devices to date. Indoor air purifier units can help reduce tiny parts of virus in the air (airborne contaminants) in a home or confined space if they are used correctly, but they are not enough to protect people from COVID-19.\n",

    "Question": "How effective is it to use only a face shield to protect from COVID-19?",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "Nigeria"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Face shields are a type of personal protective equipment (PPE), along with masks, protective eye goggles, gloves, gowns, and other equipment. Proper use of PPE can help reduce the spread of COVID-19, yet some people are asking experts about minimum PPE recommendations. This may be due to access barriers (ex. cost, limited supply), use barriers (ex. heat, difficulty breathing, physical discomfort, aesthetics), cleaning and maintenance barriers, or other reasons. It is important to remember that PPE is a risk reduction measure that lowers the chances of infection, which is different from risk avoidance measures (completely eliminating risks is not always possible, particularly when exposed to other people who could transmit COVID-19).\n\nThis entry was updated with new information on August 07, 2020.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Wearing only a face shield to protect from COVID-19 is not as effective as wearing a mask, or wearing a face shield in combination with a mask. \nCloth face masks primarily protect people in close proximity to the mask wearer. This is because face masks cover a person's nose and mouth from all sides and are meant to trap droplets that are released when the mask wearer speaks, sneezes, coughs or sings. This is particularly relevant in the case of COVID-19 where many infected patients are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic and therefore can spread the virus to others without feeling any symptoms. Face masks also offer some protection to the wearer by filtering out virus particles trying to enter and reducing exposure to the virus coming from other people.\nFace shields primarily protect the person wearing it. This is because face shields have the advantage of protecting the entire face, including the eyes, and often prevent people from touching their faces. However, due to insufficient research to date, we do not know how effective face shields are at protecting people in close proximity to the person wearing the face shield, in case that person is infected with COVID-19. \n",

    "Question": "What do we know about the Moderna vaccine so far?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background and context": "Over 165 vaccines against the coronavirus are in development around the world, and approximately 25 are in human trials. Moderna was the first American company to test a vaccine in humans. The genetic vaccine, which uses genetic material from the virus (called mRNA) to prompt the immune system to fight the virus, was developed by researchers at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Because this vaccine was the first to be tried in humans as part of a clinical trial, it has been widely discussed and followed, and has gained more media attention recently due to Moderna publishing promising Phase 1 results on July 14, and announcing that they are moving into a Phase 3 trial starting July 27. A phase 2 trial in 600 healthy adults is ongoing. Moderna hopes to have the vaccine ready by early 2021.\n\nThe results from the Moderna Phase 1 trial show that those who received the vaccine produced more antibodies that neutralized the virus **-- **meaning the antibodies successfully defended cells from the virus by blocking any effect the virus has biologically**.** These results have prompted wider discussion of a few open questions regarding the success of this vaccine and the others in development: 1) Can the production of antibodies predict protection against an infection? 2) Can antibodies predict protection against the level of infection, and 3) Will the antibodies produced last for a long time? and if yes, for how long? Research is ongoing to answer these questions. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Following encouraging results of phase 1 vaccine clinical trials, Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine is expected to start phase 3 trials on July 27, 2020 with 30,000 participants age 18 and older. A phase 2 trial in 600 healthy adults is ongoing. There are typically three phases of vaccine clinical trials, where Phase 3 is the last one conducted on a large amount of people. Phase 3 seeks to confirm results obtained in Phase 1 and Phase 2 with respect to safety and efficacy of the vaccine before approving it for manufacturing and distribution. In the upcoming Moderna Phase 3 trial, patients will be randomly assigned to receive two vaccine doses or a placebo.** **A placebo is a harmless, inactive substance that physically looks like the vaccine being tested, so researchers can make a comparison.\n\nModerna published early results in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) on July 14, 2020, based on Phase 1 trials with 45 participants, between age 18 and 55, receiving two vaccine doses each. The participants were split evenly into 3 groups to test different amounts of the vaccine: 25, 100, and 250 micrograms. While no major safety concerns were found that would stop the trials, over half of the participants experienced side effects such as fatigue, chills, headache, muscle aches, and pain at the injection site. The participants receiving the highest vaccine dose (250 micrograms) had more severe side effects. A phase 2 trial is ongoing and is evaluating doses of 50 and 100 micrograms in participants. The next phase (Phase 3) of the clinical trial will focus on studying the middle vaccine amount (100 micrograms).\n\nBy day 43 of the Phase 1 trial, researchers observed immune responses in all participants that could reduce the ability of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to infect people by 80% or more. By day 57, participants who received 100 micrograms of the vaccine had average levels of neutralizing antibodies that were about twice the average levels found in patients who have recovered from COVID-19. Neutralizing antibodies, made from plasma cells (a type of white blood cell), are a subset of antibodies (special proteins that help the body to fight viruses, bacteria, and other threats that can make people sick) that reduce the ability of a virus to infect cells and cause disease. More research is being conducted to ensure the Moderna vaccine is safe for use by diverse populations, and effective in providing long-term immunity that can protect people from getting sick when exposed to the virus.\n\n",

      "Canada"
    ],
    "Background and context": "In recent years, there has been a significant interest in the development of therapies and other consumer products derived from cannabis and its components, including cannabidiol (CBD). The U.S. FDA has approved only one CBD product, a prescription drug product to treat two rare, severe forms of epilepsy. In the context of COVID-19, media reported the results of a preprint study indicating the possibility that cannabis could prevent COVID-19 by blocking the virus' entry into the lungs. This study has not gone through the peer review process, has not been assessed by peers, and has not published in any scientific journal. \n",
    "What our experts say": "There is no reliable evidence so far to suggest that cannabis can prevent, treat or cure COVID-19. One pre-print (a type of study that is yet to be peer-reviewed) from Canada suggests possible anti-inflammatory properties in cannabis may be effective in future treatments of the disease. The study also suggests that cannabis could be used to prevent infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into cells in the human body by interacting with the ACE2 receptor protein, which is found on the surface of many cells. This study suggests that cannabidiol (CBD), one of the active ingredients in cannabis, may affect the virus' ability to bind to the ACE2 receptor protein and enter cells. However, none of the claims in the pre-print study have been validated in large-scale studies, and pre-print data should always be treated with caution. \n\nAnother lab, in Israel, is studying the effects of cannabis on the immune system's response to COVID-19 and analyzing the potential for molecules in cannabis to prevent the virus from entering cells and spreading. This research, however, has been undertaken by a cannabis research and development company based in Israel, and not independently verified by other scientific studies that are not linked to the cannabis industry. At this point, there is insufficient independent research to make any claims about the use of cannabis in preventing, treating, or curing COVID-19.\n",

    "Question": "What is COVID-19 delirium?",
    "Status": "Update ready for review",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Recent studies have shown a concerning trend of delirium in COVID-19 patients, without predisposition for age or gender. Often, this manifests in the central nervous system. Unfortunately, documentation is often missed in 75% of delirium cases, which has been challenging for the identification of COVID-19 related incidents. As more research is pointing to COVID-19 delirium being a trend in hospitalized patients, there is a need to ensure documentation occurs. \n",
    "What our experts say": "COVID-19 delirium occurs in patients who have a sudden onset of mental disturbances that results in confusion and a lack of accurate perceptions regarding their environment and current state. Delirium itself is a change in mental abilities that results in the inability to think clearly, reduced awareness, and often emotional shifts. Delirium often occurs rapidly in patients and is frequently attributed to severe or chronic illness, changes in metabolism (the reactions and processes in your body that convert food into energy), infections, and other factors. Researchers and doctors have been drawing attention to the fact that regardless of age, potentially 1/3 of COVID-19 patients can develop symptoms of delirium. More recent studies have seen delirium in 20-30% of hospitalized patients with higher rates occurring in critically ill patients (upwards of 60-70%). For example, Vanderbilt University Medical Center launched a study in July 2020 that will study delirium, among other impacts on the brain, in patients who have been hospitalized with COVID-19. The researchers share that in previous studies of intensive care patients similar to COVID-19 patients, 33-50% experience dementia. Delirium can lead to longer hospital stays, which increases the risk for complications. \n\nThis entry was updated with new information on August 20, 2020.\n",

    "Question": "Do positivity rates show herd immunity has been reached?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Immunity",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & herd immunity",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Partner Organization"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "A recent Facebook post from August 4, 2020, falsely claimed that the current national positivity rate demonstrates that herd immunity has been reached for COVID-19. The post attempted to analyze a positivity rate graph from Johns Hopkins, but also included the author's own insights about testing, population level risk assessments, and added in 'bumps' to describe what he assumed were increases in testing. Though the post noted that the author believed an increase in positivity rates were being reported for political reasons (extending the shutdowns and requiring continued mask use) there is no evidence to support this claim. Additionally, there is no evidence to support claims that we've reached herd immunity, that COVID-19 positivity rates indicate anything about a population's immunity, or that 60% of a population needs to be infected in order to reach herd immunity for the virus. \n",
    "What our experts say": "No, positivity rates of COVID-19 are not an indication of herd immunity. The rate of positivity in a community is defined as the percentage of total COVID-19 tests that come back positive out of all the people who have been tested in that community or population within a given time period. Positivity rates can indicate an increasing outbreak, if the rate of positive tests increases while the amount of testing stays the same. A positivity rate can also indicate that not enough tests are being conducted, if more tests come back with positive results but tests were conducted on a smaller percentage of the population than the week before. Neither of these have anything to do with herd immunity.\n\n\"Herd immunity\" refers to a given percentage of people that need to become immunized to a virus, through vaccines or through becoming infected in a natural setting, against a virus in order to provide safety for an entire population—i.e. the herd. It's the idea that if most people are immune, then the rate of transmission will be low or non-existent. COVID-19 is not vaccine-preventable at this time and we know very little about how we become immune to the virus. Herd immunity would require a large majority of the population to become infected with the virus and obtain long-term immunity to COVID-19 — but since we know so little about long-term immunity right now, we can't say anything about herd immunity in relation to COVID-19.\n\nPercent positive rates of COVID-19 are not being used to determine herd immunity in a community because we know so little about immunity in general, and because positive rates can mean a wide variety of things. If there is a higher percentage of positive test results in a region, this is not indicative of any potential for herd immunity, because evidence to support long-term immunity is lacking.\n",

    "Question": "Does Vitamin D help prevent or treat COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & Vitamin D",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Vitamin D is an essential nutrient, which means your body needs it but cannot make it on its own. This is why people have to get their Vitamin D from foods like salmon or egg yolks, supplements, or from spending short amounts of time in the sun. Vitamin D helps ensure your body's immune system and its cells are working well so they can respond to infections and viruses. In addition to its help in retaining calcium levels in the body and promoting bone health, Vitamin D can also potentially reduce cancer cell growth, help minimize inflammation, and help control infections. However, there is no evidence that Vitamin D can prevent or treat COVID-19, despite its other benefits in the body.\n",
    "What our experts say": "It is too early to tell whether or not Vitamin D can help treat COVID-19. As of now, Vitamin D has not been tested for its effectiveness in treating COVID-19 patients, so there is no evidence that it can prevent or treat the virus. A recent study looked at data from 20 European countries and noted that in places where more people had cases of Vitamin D deficiency, they also had higher rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths. While this study suggested a possible relationship between lower levels of Vitamin D and poor COVID-19 health outcomes, there is no evidence that Vitamin D levels actually caused more cases or deaths related to COVID-19. \n\nOther studies have noted potential links between low Vitamin D levels and COVID-19, but no consensus has been reached on what the potential impact of the vitamin is on the virus. Researchers are now working on several studies to determine if Vitamin D can be effective in treating COVID-19.\n",

    "Question": "What does it mean for COVID-19 to impact the brain?",
    "Status": "Update ready for review",
    "Category": "Symptoms",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & the brain",
    "Background and context": "COVID-19 has been linked to a series of health complications beyond respiratory failure, including neurological complications that can potentially damage the brain. Recently, news has been circulating about how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been associated with many different neurological syndromes, including nerve damage, delirium, and stroke. While the condition is not very common, doctors are currently looking at data from individual patients from around the world to assess how it has impacted patients.\n\nThese neurological complications have also been reported during previous epidemics, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak more recently in 2012.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Physicians and scientists are learning more about how COVID-19 impacts organs outside of the respiratory system, such as the brain. The emerging evidence has revealed that some COVID-19 patients experience neurological symptoms, which impact the nervous system, composed principally of the brain, spinal cord, nerves, and ganglia (cell bodies that relay nerve signals). \n\nIn early March 2020, observational data from 58 patients in France indicated the presence of neurological symptoms such as agitation, confusion, disorientation, and encephalopathy (brain damage). In April 2020, a study was published on 214 COVID-19 patients in China with \"severe infection,\" where over a third were reported to experience neurological symptoms, including acute cerebrovascular diseases and impaired consciousness.\n\nIn July 2020, another study on over 40 British patients provided additional evidence about neurological symptoms, ranging from brain inflammation and delirium to nerve damage and stroke. Some of these patients reported severe symptoms, such as strokes and paralysis resulting from nerve damage, while others experienced more minor symptoms like breathlessness and fatigue. Most of the cases with brain inflammation were diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), which is a rare illness involving inflammation of the brain and spinal cord that results from viral infections. Data from London indicated an increase in ADEM cases for this study period during the pandemic, as the number of reported cases would typically have been expected over a 5-month period rather than a 5-week period in the city. \n\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was not detected in the cerebrospinal brain fluid of any of the British patients tested, which may suggest that the virus did not directly attack the brain and that the symptoms could have occurred post-infection.\n\nVanderbilt University Medical Center launched a study in July 2020 that will study delirium, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression in patients who have been hospitalized with COVID-19. These disabling impacts are also known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), and previous studies of intensive care patients similar to COVID-19 patients suggest that 33-50% experience dementia, 10-20% experience PTSD, and 33% experience major depression. Researchers are also studying whether COVID-19 patients with brain inflammation are at higher risk of autoimmune disorders like demyelination, where the protective coating of nerve cells is attacked by the immune system and may lead to weakness, numbness and difficulty with daily activities.\n\nWith the increasing evidence of neurological symptoms, which have not been found to occur as commonly as respiratory symptoms, researchers and health care practitioners are continuing to observe patients around the world to learn more about how COVID-19 impacts on the brain. The long-term implications are still unclear, since COVID-19 is a new disease and there has not been enough time to observe the development of symptoms in patients over long periods of time.\n\nThis entry was updated with new information on August 20, 2020.\n",

    "Background and context": "Recently, a huge amount of misinformation has come out regarding face masks and their potential impacts on people. Since the World Health Organization and U.S. CDC have recommended wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19, face masks have become a target of political discussions. This is likely due to the fact that in the early months of 2020, face masks were not yet recommended by these groups for a number of reasons, including a lack of evidence that they would be effective (since then research has been conducted and we have proof of their effectiveness) and a general shortage of masks for doctors and healthcare professionals. As more research studies were completed and more evidence made it clear that face masks were effective in helping the spread of COVID-19, the face mask policies also changed.\n",
    "What our experts say": "No. There is no proof that wearing a mask can reduce oxygen levels, also known as hypoxia. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) recommend wearing cloth masks in public, which are not too tight on our faces and allow for easy breathing.\n\nEven doctors and healthcare professionals wearing N95 masks (which fit very tightly around the face and are made to create a seal around the edge of the mask) are not at risk of hypoxia. However, for any person with preexisting lung or breathing problems in general, they should speak with their doctors about their concerns regarding masks. \n",

    ],
    "Background and context": "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is an important vitamin that is part of natural processes that happen in the body that support immune function, maintain blood vessel structure, control inflammation, and help with healing. Vitamin C is naturally found in a variety of fruits and vegetables (i.e. oranges, mangoes, peppers, kiwi, strawberries, tomatoes), and it is also added to foods to help preserve them for a longer shelf-life. Vitamin C is commonly taken as a supplement (often as a pill or powder). While vitamin C supplements are typically considered to be safe, side effects can include nausea, cramps, acid reflux, and an increased risk of kidney stones. \n\nVitamin C supplements are being evaluated for patients with COVID-19 because vitamin C has been shown to slightly shorten the length of time that someone has a cold, and may reduce the severity of a cold, but the research is unclear and most studies have only shown a benefit for patients who have a low vitamin C status (deficiency). There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that taking vitamin C prevents colds.\n\nVitamin C deficiency does affect how the immune system works and may reduce a person’s ability to fight infections. Vitamin C deficiency is not common for most people with a varied diet; however smokers, pregnant women, older adults, and people with major injuries (i.e. burns) are at increased risk.\n\nThis entry was updated with new information on August 4, 2020\n",
    "What our experts say": "There is no scientific evidence to suggest that taking vitamin C will prevent against or cure COVID-19; and, though studies are underway, there is not enough scientific evidence to recommend taking vitamin C as part of a treatment for COVID-19 unless it is part of a study protocol. Vitamin C is being tested as a possible combination therapy (a treatment used with other medications or therapies) for very ill patients with and without COVID-19- particularly those with major infections and sepsis. Studies of the effect of vitamin C supplements on patients with COVID-19 are ongoing. \n\nThis entry was updated with new information on August 4, 2020\n",

    "Question": "What do we know about ghee or coconut oil in the nose as a treatment for COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Treatment",
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "India"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Ghee (clarified butter) and coconut oil are being discussed during the COVID-19 pandemic, in part because India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has recommended that citizens follow guidelines from the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Sidda, and Homeopathy (AYNUSH). Ayurveda is a form of traditional medicine with roots in ancient India, while Unani is a form of traditional medicine originating in ancient Greece that is now practiced primarily in India, and Sidda is a form of traditional medicine from Tamil Nadu in Southern India. Traditional medicine is used around the world, and is considered a form of alternative medicine distinct from formalized and science-based conventional medical care. While some people have experienced benefits in using traditional medicine as a complementary part of their medical care, doctors and scientists have also voiced safety and efficacy concerns about certain practices.\n\nThe AYNUSH guidelines, which have not been fully backed by scientific and clinical studies, encourage consuming certain drinks (hot water, golden milk made with turmeric, and herbal drinks made with basil, cinnamon, black pepper, and dried ginger), using certain spices (turmeric, cumin, and others), practicing yoga, applying sesame or coconut oil in the nose, rinsing the mouth with sesame oil, practicing steam inhalation, using clove mixed with honey for a cough, and consuming Chyawanprash (a cooked Ayurveda mixture that includes ghee, which some people use as a dietary supplement to try to boost immune system function). Though this advice has been widely shared across media channels, the Indian government's press release only says that Ayurveda \"may possibly boost an individual’s immunity against infections,\" and includes a disclaimer stating that the “advisory does not claim to be treatment for COVID-19.” There is no evidence that any of these remedies prevent, treat or cure COVID-19.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Though they are part of traditional Ayurvedic medicine, there is no scientific evidence that nasal treatments of ghee, coconut oil, and sesame oil will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19. While many types of fats or oils (like coconut oil, sesame oil, and others) have been shown to kill or stop bad bacteria in cell-based laboratory studies, most of these studies have focused on how these ingredients may be used to prevent bacterial growth on food to improve food safety. Studies have not looked at the effect of ghee, coconut, or sesame oils on prevention of viral or bacterial infections in humans when applied in the nose, and there is no scientific evidence that supports the theory that applying these oils in the nose would improve health or prevent illness.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and other international health leaders have continued to state that caution is needed when considering “traditional remedies” as a treatment for COVID-19. They also state that there is “no therapy that has been proven to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.” \n",

    "Question": "Is paracetamol effective in treating or curing COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "India"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Paracetamol is an analgesic (pain reliever) that can address minor to moderate cases of aches, pains, and fever; other common names for paracetamol are acetaminophen, Tylenol, and Dolo 650. Acetaminophen is often confused with ibuprofen, another pain reliever that is commonly referred to as Advil, one of the commercial brands of ibuprofen. The main difference between the two is that ibuprofen has anti-inflammatory effects, making it a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) whereas acetaminophen does not, and therefore is not considered an NSAID.\n\nConfusion between the two was exacerbated in the context of COVID-19 following a tweet in mid-March by France’s Minister of Solidarity and Health, which claimed that taking anti-inflammatory drugs (such as Advil) could contribute to worsening a COVID-19 infection, and that acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) should be taken instead. The WHO initially took a similar position, recommending that ibuprofen be avoided for treating symptoms of COVID-19, but changed their stance on March 19 to say that they do not recommend avoiding ibuprofen to treat COVID-19 symptoms. Though there is no strong evidence that ibuprofen worsens COVID-19 symptoms, some public health bodies such as UK's National Health Service only recommend taking acetaminophen for COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nAccording to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the daily _maximum_ oral dose for adults is 3 grams per day though other sources (including the Merck Manual) suggest that up to 4 grams per day is generally well tolerated in healthy adults. Paracetamol can be toxic to the liver in high doses or when used in combination with alcohol, some other medications, or for patients with existing liver or kidney problems, those who are malnourished or underweight, or those of advanced age. It is important to follow packaging instructions carefully when taking this or any over the counter medications, and a medical professional should be consulted for additional, personalized guidance.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 4th, 2020_\n",
    "What our experts say": "Paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen, Tylenol, Dolo 650) can help relieve symptoms associated with COVID-19, but it cannot cure the viral infection.\n\nParacetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a medication commonly used for mild to moderate pain and aches relief, and fever reduction. Since some people infected with COVID-19 experience fever, body aches and headaches, this drug has been prescribed to relieve those symptoms. Paracetamol can provide some relief for patients with these symptoms, but it is not a cure against COVID-19.\n\nParacetamol made news headlines early in the pandemic because some governments, including the United Kingdom and France, and the World Health Organization encouraged people with COVID-19 to take paracetamol rather than ibuprofen – another drug used to help manage symptoms like fever, headache, or body aches. At the time, there were concerns about a link between ibuprofen and other drugs that could be prescribed to COVID-19 patients (such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs) that could lead to an increased risk for illness or for worsening of COVID-19 symptoms. As the pandemic evolved, the WHO changed their stance on March 19 2020 to say that they do not recommend avoiding ibuprofen to treat COVID-19 symptoms. \n\nWhile paracetamol is routinely used to relieve COVID-19 symptoms, it is important to strictly respect the dosage prescribed as stated on the medication bottle. The dosage of paracetamol for adults is 1-2 500 milligram tablets up to four times in 24 hours, with at least four hours in between doses. Any higher amount can be dangerous and is not advised.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 4th, 2020_\n",

    "Background and context": "While there are no current medications or treatments that prevent or treat COVID-19, many medications, including antihistamines, are being evaluated as possible treatments. Antihistamines are medications that are often available without a prescription and may be used to treat allergies (including runny nose, hives, itchy eyes) as well as insect bites, motion sickness, and insomnia.\n\nHistamines are released in the body when there is something harmful (like an infection or an allergen—something that someone has an allergy to), and histamines cause allergy symptoms like runny nose, itchy eyes, sneezing, and rashes. Histamines can also cause swelling of blood vessels and skin. Antihistamines block the histamine reaction and decrease these symptoms or, in some cases, make the symptoms go away entirely. Similarly, in the case of COVID-19, scientists are studying whether or not antihistamines may improve some of the COVID-19 symptoms. Using antihistamines to treat symptoms of COVID-19 is an example of repurposing medications.\n\nWhile developing a new medication may be possible for some new illnesses, sometimes existing medications are evaluated as treatments for new illnesses. By repurposing medications, the side effects are already understood so gaining approval may be faster than with new medicines.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Antihistamines are medications people can purchase over the counter without a prescription to help improve their allergy symptoms. They are among the many medications being researched as potential treatment options for COVID-19. Few studies about the efficacy of antihistamines as a treatment for COVID-19 are complete, and there is no evidence that supports the theory that antihistamines are an effective treatment for the virus. Current research is investigating whether some antihistamine medications like cloperastine, clemastine, and Azelastine can help improve symptoms or shorten the duration of COVID-19 infections, but early research has only identified these potential medications in laboratories. That means that they have not completed testing these medications in humans, so we don't know if they have any impact.\n\nCetirizine (an antihistamine medication also known as Zyrtec) is currently being studied with famotidine (an antihistamine and antacid medication) to see whether it can be effective in treating COVID-19, particularly in patients with very aggressive immune system responses. An early study in a pre-print journal that has not been reviewed by experts or published yet, found promising results for helping ease symptoms in hospitalized patients. The study did not have a control group to compare these patients to (which is generally part of published studies on medication) and had a small population size. Overall, there has yet to be evidence that antihistamines —including certirizine—can treat COVID-19.\n",

    "Background and context": "While no health organizations have recommended the use of gasoline and/or diesel as a disinfectant, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has publicly said that people who cannot afford disinfects can use gasoline to clean masks and surfaces, during two separate televised briefings. While a representative then suggested that the initial comment was a joke, President Duterte made the same recommendation again and claimed he was not joking. Within a few hours of his statement, Integrated Chemists of the Philippines and national health groups responded, warning that the use of gasoline as a disinfectant does not protect against the virus that causes COVID-19 and can be harmful to human health (such as by leading to chemical irritation and bodily damage, increasing the risk of burns, etc.). People without access to commercial disinfectants can clean fabric masks, surfaces and skin by washing thoroughly with soap and water, followed by air-drying.\n",
    "What our experts say": "No. Gasoline and/or diesel should not be used as a disinfectant, does not work as a disinfectant, has not been shown to kill the virus that causes COVID-19, and may be very harmful to human health.\n\nAccording to the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, gasoline exposure through the skin or eyes, drinking, or breathing can cause many health problems including the following:\n·      Irritation or burns of the eyes, skin, or mucous membranes (i.e. the tissues in the nose, eyes, mouth, throat)\n·      Headache, weakness, blurred vision, dizziness, slurred speech, confusion, convulsions\n·      Chemical pneumonitis (when liquid gasoline is inhaled into the lungs and causes damage)\n·      Possible liver or kidney damage\n·      Long-term exposure may cause cancer\n·      Gasoline is flammable and improper storage / use can lead to fires and burn injuries\n\nGasoline exposure should be avoided and, if accidental exposure does happen, washing the exposed area is important. When exposed to gas fumes, it is important to leave the area where the fumes are to an area with fresh air or ventilation. Seek medical help for breathing problems as well as slurred speech, dizziness, confusion, or other symptoms of neurological (brain and nervous system) problems. \n",

    "Question": "What are human challenge trials for vaccines?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Prevention",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & vaccines",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "In a human challenge trial, a volunteer receives a potential vaccine and then the volunteer is intentionally exposed to the virus to see if the vaccine works. Human challenge trials are sometimes used to test vaccines for illnesses that have a known cure (like malaria and cholera), but there are ethical problems in performing a human challenge trial for COVID-19. With COVID-19, there is a risk that someone could become seriously ill or even die from an infection since there is not a known cure.\nKnowing that human challenge trials may be needed, and as treatments and vaccines are developed for COVID-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued guidance to scientists, doctors, ethicists, and researchers in May 2020. The WHO document provides an overview of the ethics involved, reviews why the studies are being considered, and lists eight criteria for studies to meet for possible consideration. The criteria are designed to ensure that there is adequate scientific justification, that risks and benefits have been carefully considered, that studies are performed with consultation and coordination among members of the public as well as experts and policy-makers, and that study sites are equipped to conduct research to meet the highest clinical and ethical standards, and to ensure that participants are selected to minimize risk.\nHuman challenge trials take many months to plan and, in the setting of a global pandemic, many experts argue that there is no time to waste in planning for these trials to begin. In an open letter to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, 15 Nobel Laureates and over 100 top scientists and researchers encouraged preparation for human challenge trials for COVID-19 vaccines. The letter was organized by an advocacy group that has collected human challenge trial volunteer signatures from more than 30,000 people in over 140 countries.\n",
    "What our experts say": "A human challenge trial (HCT) is a study that deliberately infects volunteers with a virus after they've been given a vaccine, in order to see if the vaccine is effective. HCTs are designed to do this by taking a group of healthy volunteers in which researchers give half of the group a vaccine for a specific illness, and the other half a placebo (a fake drug they think is a real vaccine). Next, the researchers purposely expose the entire group to the real virus in a laboratory at a high enough dosage for them all to become infected. After being exposed to the virus, if the group that was given the vaccine does not become sick and the other group does fall ill, it means the vaccine is effective. The HCT process also allows researchers to see if any side effects might occur after volunteers are given the vaccine, which is an important part of studying vaccines.\n\nHCTs are different than more traditional vaccine trials, which give half of a group of healthy volunteers a vaccine for a specific illness and the other half of the group a placebo, in order to see how bodies respond when they are exposed to the virus in their day-to-day lives, outside of the laboratory. In comparison to these other types of vaccine trials, one potential benefit of HCTs is how quickly all the volunteers are exposed to the virus, so researchers might know more rapidly whether or not their vaccine is effective. Other benefits of HCTs include the fact that HCTs are done in settings where researchers can control the amount of time that passes, who gets to participate in the trial, and how volunteers are exposed to the virus, and they can also involve a smaller number of participants than other medication studies. Comparatively, the way HCTs are designed means they are not able to resemble how people get infected by viruses in the real world, outside of labs, and the amount of people involved in the trials might be much smaller than would participate in more traditional trials.\n\nHCTs are controversial and have caused debates about the ethics of infecting healthy volunteers with a virus that doesn't have a cure and can ultimately cause death. Though HCTs have studied medications for illnesses like typhoid, cholera, and malaria, those diseases all had proven medical treatments that could stop disease progression if the vaccine did not work. In the case of COVID-19, few treatment options exist so the amount of risk involved — even in healthy, young, willing volunteers — might be too great for researchers to take on.\n",

      "Senegal"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Recent international studies and headlines have focused on the possible link between male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia) and the likelihood of becoming infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. The research behind this news was on adults hospitalized in Spain with COVID-19, which found that a higher percentage of the sick men had some kind of hair loss or baldness, in comparison to the percentage of the general population experiencing hair loss. The findings were misreported in the news as \"bald men are more likely to have COVID-19,\" but it is important to take into account how there were issues in the research mentioned above and also how certain people who are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 (men, older people) are also more likely to have hair loss.\n\nIn related research, scientists have been trying to understand why men are more likely to have severe cases of COVID-19 than women, by considering the impact of androgen (a hormone that is an important part of male sexual development from before birth and through puberty, which is also linked to sex drive and hair growth). However, there has been no evidence to support this claim about baldness, and other research studies focusing on androgens** **are still underway.\n",
    "What our experts say": "No, it is not safe to say in scientific terms that bald men are more likely to have COVID-19. In May 2020, a research study was widely reported in news headlines, which suggested male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia) could mean higher risks for severe COVID-19 symptoms. However, this is not exactly what the researchers found. The authors of this publication also acknowledged there were research limitations meaning their results cannot be generalized to a larger population and further studies are needed. \n\nPublished in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (JAAD), the researchers wrote that out of 122 men and 53 women admitted with COVID-19 to hospitals in Madrid, Spain, they found 79% of the male patients had some hair loss or baldness (alopecia) while estimating the prevalence of baldness in the general population is only 31%-53%. However, the researchers acknowledged limitations of their findings, including how only 175 people were studied (in research terminology, this is considered a** **small sample size that limits how findings can be generalized to a larger population). They also acknowledged that patients in the study were all admitted to a hospital with COVID-19, meaning there was no comparison group (control group) of participants without COVID-19 to compare the findings against the general population. \n\nAdditionally, the research did not include information about patient outcomes (such as how the patients fared after they were admitted to the hospital), so it was not possible for researchers to compare outcomes for patients with and without baldness. In general, many researchers and doctors have cautioned that older people and men are more likely to have severe cases of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization, and older men are also more likely to be bald. For these reasons, \"bald men are more likely to have COVID-19\" is an incorrect interpretation of the published research.\n",

    "Background and context": "Many medications are sometimes considered as a treatment for illnesses that are different than those for which they were originally created (also called repurposing medications).  Research studies are trying to see if any existing medication might help treat COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. Recently, both these medications have been in the news due to several national leaders and various groups claiming that these medications can prevent, treat and even cure COVID-19. The research around hydroxychloroquine and choloroquine to date has shown no efficacy of these medications against COVID-19. This is based on randomized controlled trials (the most scientifically strong and valued type of research trials). More studies are underway to learn more about the potential impact of these drugs on COVID-19. As of now, both medicines are not proven nor approved treatments for the coronavirus.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Chloroquine is a medication that is taken to prevent or treat malaria, which is transmitted by mosquitoes bites. It's also used to treat some intestinal infections. On the other hand, hydroxychloroquine is a medication that is also taken to prevent and treat malaria, but it can also treat other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Both of these medications are antimalarials, but hydroxychloroquine is a newer, slightly altered version of chloroquine that has fewer side effects and dissolves more easily in the body, so it is often considered a safer medication for patients to take. \n\nDespite recent media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, neither chloroquine nor hydroxychloroquine are approved treatments against COVID-19. Several research studies conducted around the world have demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine is likely not effective against COVID-19. \n",

    "Question": "What do we know so far about airborne transmission and how does it differ from respiratory droplet transmission? ",
    "Status": "Updated literature",
    "Category": "Transmission",
    "Subcategory": "Differences between airborne transmission and respiratory droplets",
    "Background and context": "Respiratory droplet transmission happens when disease, in this case COVID-19, spreads through droplets expelled by an infected person, through coughing, sneezing, talking, or even just breathing; these droplets are larger than 5-10 micrometers. One micrometer is one millionth of a meter. Respiratory droplets are relatively heavy, and fall to the ground quickly. In contrast, airborne transmission is when residue from droplets smaller than 5 micrometers, or dust particles carrying the virus, stay suspended in the air for a while and travel as their air moves. Scientists and the World Health Organization (WHO) have recognized that evidence is emerging on the possibility of airborne transmission, particularly in crowded, closed, poorly ventilated settings. If airborne transmission of COVID-19 is significant, this has major implications for containment efforts (ex. masks may be needed indoors and even in socially-distant settings, ventilation systems may need to minimize recirculating air and find ways to filter or disinfect contaminated air, etc.). \n",
    "What our experts say": "There is increasing evidence that COVID-19 can spread through airborne transmission, which is when a person infected with COVID-19 releases tiny droplets of fluid into the air called 'droplet nuclei' by coughing, sneezing, talking, or during some medical procedures. Droplet nuclei are very light, relatively dry, and microscopic in size so they can remain suspended in the air like a mist, which is why airborne transmission is also called 'aerosol transmission', and pose a risk of infection to people in close proximity or people sitting in areas that are poorly ventilated. This is different from the main theory that the virus spreads through bigger respiratory droplets that are heavier, fall to the ground relatively quickly, and do not remain suspended in the air or spread through the air. \n\nResearchers are still studying aerosol transmission, but the World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledged emerging evidence regarding airborne transmission in poorly ventilated spaces. Public health experts have repeatedly warned that airborne transmission is most likely contributing to transmission, especially in indoor spaces, and recommendations should incorporate the need for sufficient ventilation, high efficiency filtration, and limiting crowded spaces, in addition to universal adoption of masks, social distancing, and frequent hand washing with soap and water. New studies about previous outbreaks, such as the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak, found that the virus spread rapidly between passengers due to aerosol transmission through small droplets that were light enough to linger in the air. Yet another study found evidence of the novel coronavirus in the air from isolated individuals who had COVID-19. These studies highlight the importance of combining proper ventilation with cloth masks and social distancing to prevent transmission of the virus.\n\nThis entry was updated with new information on August 03, 2020.\n\n\n",

    "Background and context": "Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause a variety of different illnesses, but primarily upper-respiratory tract illnesses in humans. These illnesses include the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Some viruses can originate in animals and later infect humans, and this can happen in a number of different ways, including: by eating meat or produce that has been contaminated by the virus, through the air or by touching a surface that was touched by an infected animal, through close contact with an infected animal, or through insect bites. Not all viruses transfer from animals to humans in all of these ways, it depends on the virus. The resources section contains more information about this. \n\n",
    "What our experts say": "COVID-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China in late 2019. The virus has since been partially traced back to a large seafood and animal market in the city of Wuhan, after several people who had been to the market became sick with the illness we now know as COVID-19. Scientists were able to use genetic tests to confirm that the virus was first identified in people in the city of Wuhan. Tests on the genetics of viruses, much like genetics in humans, can reveal a lot about their origins. \nThe majority of scientific studies now support the idea that the origin of the virus in animals was bats, specifically horseshoe bats, potentially from China or neighboring countries of Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam. Scientists also suggest that the virus may have been passed to humans through an intermediate host before spreading to humans, but are unsure about what animal the host might have been, though pangolins and civets have been suggested. The details about that event, which is called a zoonotic transfer, are still being investigated. World Health Organization experts will soon travel to China and work with Chinese health officials to identify the source of the virus.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on July 16, 2020_\n\n",

    "Background and context": "The BGC vaccine, or the bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine, is a vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) disease. This vaccine is used in many countries that have high rates of tuberculosis in order to prevent the disease from spreading. As public health researchers try and understand the low case numbers and death count in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South-East Asia from COVID-19, hypotheses have emerged about the protective power of the BCG vaccine against the coronavirus because of a correlation between countries where the BCG vaccine is widely used and the low number of COVID-19 cases reported in those countries. Recent studies published on this topic do not support the idea that BCG vaccination in childhood has a protective effect against COVID-19 in adulthood. More studies are underway as it's still not clear yet how the BCG vaccine interacts with the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "Multiple studies are exploring the link between BCG vaccination policies in various countries, and the relatively lower number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in those countries. Recent studies published do not support the idea that BCG vaccination in childhood is a cause of protection against COVID-19 in adulthood. The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a note on this topic that stated that in the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19. \n\nA study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (U.S.) noted that after they accounted for differences in variables like income, age distribution, and access to health services, countries with higher BCG vaccination rates had lower peak mortality rates from COVID-19. However, though there is an association between BCG vaccination and reduced severity of COVID-19 observed in this epidemiological study, it does not mean that there is enough evidence to consider BCG vaccination a cause of protection from severe COVID-19. More studies are underway. \n_This entry was updated with new information on July 11, 2020_\n",

    "Source of the question": [

      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "There are over 165 vaccines against COVID-19 in development around the world. Approximately 25 of them are in human trials. Vaccine trials typically take years to develop, but are being expedited to be ready as early as spring 2021 to control the pandemic. \n\nVaccines are a safe, effective, and simple method of protecting people against diseases before an individual becomes exposed to them. Vaccines can also help lessen the severity of a disease if someone is infected. All vaccines work to create antibodies to fight the foreign germ - in this case, the SARS-CoV-2 virus. But there has been confusion around the types of vaccines in development due to the high amount of vaccines being developed, as well as new technologies being tested that haven’t been used in a licensed vaccine before, such as mRNA vaccines which are currently being researched.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Historically, there are four main types of vaccines: \n\n- Live-attenuated vaccines\n- Inactivated vaccines\n- Subunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines\n- Toxoid vaccines\n\nVaccine designs are based on how our immune systems respond to germs, who in the population (children, adults) needs to be vaccinated against the germ, and the best approach and technology available to create the vaccine. This is why there are different vaccine types to respond to different germs.\n\nLive-attenuated vaccines use a weaker - also called 'attenuated' - form of a living germ, which would normally cause a disease in stronger forms but is almost completely harmless in a vaccine because the virus has been weakened. Some of these live-attenuated vaccines are used to protect against diseases like measles, mumps, rubella; rotavirus; smallpox; chicken pox; and yellow fever.\n\nInactivated vaccines use the killed or inactive version of the germ, so they are not as capable at helping humans develop some immunity to a germ** **as live-attenuated vaccines and can't provide immunity for as long. These vaccines protect against diseases like hepatitis A, influenza, polio, and rabies.\n\nSubunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines use particular pieces of the germ, like its protein or sugars, to create a strong immunity to specific parts of the germ. Some illnesses these vaccines focus on are hepatitis B, HPV, whooping cough, shingles, and meningococcal disease.\n\nToxoid vaccines use a harmful product called a 'toxin' that is made by the germ. A toxin is a living organism that can normally cause harm to parts of the body like tissues when they come into contact with them. However, toxins in vaccines are harmless because they have been very weakened in laboratories as their only job is to teach the immune system how to fight the germ. They create immunity by focusing on the specific parts of the germ that cause illness instead of the entire germ. These vaccines target illnesses like diptheria and tetanus.\n\nResearchers trying to develop COVID-19 vaccines are using many of these types of approaches to vaccine design. Two new types of vaccines are gaining attention in the scientific world. One of these vaccine types use the genes of the COVID-19 vaccine called 'DNA' and 'RNA' to create a strong immune system response. The other new type of approach to vaccine development uses a platform base called 'recombinant vector vaccines' which act like how infections would impact your body normally. As we learn more about the virus and how to create immunity in people through vaccines, we will learn if any of these vaccine types can successfully prevent COVID-19 infection in people.\n",

    "Question": "Should we wipe down groceries with disinfectant before bringing inside a house?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Transmission",
    "Background and context": "Studies that look at the way COVID-19 spreads are evolving and it's leading to confusion about how we should be handling some of our most essential items — groceries. More research shows that person-to-person spread through close contact (as opposed to surface transmission, like with groceries) is the most well understood form of transmission, as well as the main transmission route for COVID-19. \n\nMixed messaging is contributing to debate around the need to wipe down groceries, wear gloves, avoid petting neighborhood animals, and other steps that would reduce surface transmission. The current research shows that surface transmission is likely very rare as a way of spreading COVID-19, but it is still a risk and it should be responded to with precaution. Therefore, public health experts recommend hand washing after bringing items inside and putting them away. \n",
    "What our experts say": "There is no evidence that food or the packaging it comes in plays a role in COVID-19 transmission. The public health community is continually learning about how the novel coronavirus spreads, and what transmission routes are most likely to make it spread. Because of this continual learning in the public health community, there has been confusion around how easily COVID-19 spreads, through which routes, and what precautions are really necessary—such as wiping down grocery packaging.\n\nAccording to recent studies, the risk of becoming infected by surfaces like food and packaging is quite low, but the same prevention measures experts have been suggesting for months should still be followed. Health experts recommend hand washing after handling produce and putting away groceries, but not that people wipe down or disinfect the packaging or belongings before coming inside. They should instead use hand washing after bringing items inside and putting them away. \n\n",

    "Question": "What does the scientific literature say about using hydroxychloroquine to prevent, treat or cure COVID-19?",

    ],
    "Background and context": "Hydroxycloroquine is a medication currently prescribed for preventing or treating malaria, an infectious disease that can be transmitted to humans from mosquitos. It is also prescribed as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, which are both autoimmune diseases.\nWhen faced with an unknown virus like COVID-19 and without a specific vaccine and treatment, one of the best medical strategies is to look among the medications already available and clinically tested to see if any of them are effective. As their risks, benefits, and side effects have already been studied (without allowing safety tests to be ignored), this could speed up research. One of these is hydroxychloroquine. \nWhen trying to find treatments for COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine was tested on hospitalized patients. However, the results from this research do not represent evidence significant enough to recommend hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19. At the same time, some research studies have also shown some serious negative consequences (incl. serious heart rhythm problems) associated with the use of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19. More studies are underway.\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "Ongoing clinical trials are testing how safe and effective chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are as treatments for COVID-19. So far, clinical trials and scientific analyses have not produced high quality evidence showing efficacy of these medications as a treatment, and some studies have even reported higher rates of adverse events (including cardiac issues) in hospitalized patients treated with hydroxychloroquine. As things stand, hydroxychloroquine is not a recognized prevention, treatment or cure for COVID-19.\nIn this context, there are research studies underway to find out whether taking this medication can prevent people from getting infected with coronavirus once they have been exposed. Other studies are still investigating the efficacy and safety of the drug as a treatment at different stages of the illness, including randomized controlled trials with a large number of patients enrolled.\nAround the world, some countries have moved ahead and authorized chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 despite limited clinical evidence supporting its efficacy. This decision follows some preliminary results coming out of China and France in March 2020, where a few small clinical trials showed limited success of the medication.\nIn the Unites States, on March 27th 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted a special permission (Emergency Authorization Use) to use chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in emergency situations for treatment of COVID-19. This did not constitute a formal approval of the drug, but rather a possibility given to American doctors to use chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 if the doctor has no other options and after discussing with the patients the risks involved. On June 15th 2020, the U.S. FDA has revoked the special permission to use chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in emergency situations for COVID-19 citing that these drugs are unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 and highlighting serious cardiac adverse events and other serious side effects reported in studies.\n",

    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "India"
    ],
    "Background and context": "A recent viral WhatsApp message circulating on closed threads in India claimed that everybody should download a digital app that functions like a digital pulse oximeter and measures oxygen levels in the blood. Digital apps claiming to accurately measure blood oxygen levels may be very inaccurate.\n\nPulse oximeters—the real ones— are used to track oxygen levels in the blood and monitor heart rate, since low oxygen levels are reported among patients experiencing severe cases of COVID-19. They are popular because they can present warning signs of an upcoming problem before it's too late. However, doctors only recommend pulse oximeters for some patients who have either been diagnosed with COVID-19 or who have other underlying health conditions. The quality of digital pulse oximeters can vary, and these devices should not be used to diagnose COVID-19, as low blood oxygen levels can occur due to a wide range of diseases. In general, public health agencies like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control do not recommend purchasing a digital pulse oximeter to track your blood oxygen levels unless directed by a doctor or in specific high-risk areas like nursing homes. If you feel like you're getting sick or experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19, you should contact a doctor right away. \n",
    "What our experts say": "A pulse oximeter is a small non-invasive, clip-like device that attaches to a finger or ear lobe to measure the level of oxygen in blood. The device sends small beams of light through the blood and then measures how much light reflects off of red blood cells. More reflection of light means more oxygen saturation, less reflection of light means less oxygen saturation. \n\nTypically a digital pulse oximeter is clipped on the tip of your finger, and you may experience a small amount of pressure without any pain during the reading. The device provides a reading of \"oxygen saturation level\" and heart rate. An oxygen saturation level of at least 95% is normal for most healthy individuals. \n\nDigital pulse oximeters are easy-to-use and painless, and most versions are quite accurate. With any digital reading, however, there is always a risk of inaccurate readings. Hospitals and other medical settings have high-quality devices, but the quality of other digital versions on the market can vary. In general, doctors recommend pulse oximeters for patients with certain underlying health conditions and lung diseases, including patients with COVID-19, to monitor their symptoms. But you should not buy a pulse oximeter to self-diagnose or monitor symptoms unless directed by a doctor.\n",

    "Question": "When do we consider someone with COVID-19 to have recovered?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Recovery",
    "Background and context": "As COVID-19 spreads, so does the number of individuals who have recovered since thankfully most patients who have COVID-19 recover from the disease. There is ongoing debate and uncertainty regarding when and on what basis can we consider that a patient has recovered from COVID-19. \n\nIn summary, deciding when a patient has recovered from COVID-19 is more complicated than just judging by the moment the patient feels better. The definition of \"recovery\" needs to include more than just the complete improvement of the patient and the absence of symptoms. \n\nDefinitions of recovery vary a lot between countries and can still be subjective to the individual patient, because more severe cases may have symptoms that last longer, and in some cases individuals can test positive even if they are no longer infectious (i.e. they can't transmit the virus to other people). \n",
    "What our experts say": "Different institutions (including hospitals, clinics, public health agencies, and government agencies) have used different criteria to define when someone with COVID-19 is considered recovered. These criteria are often used to decide when someone can be allowed to leave the hospital or can stop isolation. A review of COVID-19 recovery guidelines being used around the world show most doctors agree on the following criteria:\n1) Clinical: The patient no longer has symptoms, and\n2) Laboratory: The patient has negative test results (testing through swabs taken from the nose and throat) showing the virus is no longer present in the upper respiratory system.\nBoth of these criteria should be considered in combination to determine recovery. Negative test results are important because people can still spread the virus even if they have no symptoms or their symptoms have stopped. \n\nIn addition, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) suggests also considering the following criteria to determine if a patient has recovered:\n3) Positive serological or antibody test results from blood samples. \nAntibody tests can show if your immune system has produced antibodies to fight off COVID-19 which would signal that you had been infected with the virus. Antibody tests are typically done at least 1-3 weeks after a patient first experiences symptoms. However, antibody test results should not be used on their own to determine recovery - they should be used in combination with the other two criteria.\n\nIt is not always possible to use these recommended criteria to determine recovery. For example, some people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms (fatigue, shortness of breath, etc.) yet are not hospitalized because these symptoms are not severe enough. These mild symptoms can however persist over long periods of time (weeks to months) which further complicates how to decide if someone has recovered or not from COVID-19.\n",

    "Background and context": "COVID-19 has been shown to have varying effects on different individuals, including symptoms and secondary health effects. This range of outcomes makes it difficult to know the estimate length of impact COVID-19 might have on an individual. One example of a secondary outcome is [myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome][1] (ME/CFS) — a long-term reappearance of symptoms — clusters of which have followed many infectious outbreaks. Increased data and corresponding analysis will help to provide more empirical evidence on how long COVID-19 adversely impacts individuals, what symptoms are most prevalent, and what secondary outcomes are most common. \n\n  [1]: https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html\n",
    "What our experts say": "Because the COVID-19 virus is new, we still don't know why some people might become sick longer than others—but we do know that people infected with COVID-19 who have severe symptoms tend to have symptoms for longer than those with mild cases. \n\nDifferences in immune responses, including lower levels of antibody production, can impact how long patients remain sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 can impact many organs, which might help explain why the virus can cause symptoms that continue over a longer period of time in some patients. Akiko Iwasaki, a Yale immunology doctor, believes some potential reasons the virus lasts longer in some patients is because the virus might remain in one of the organs that is not tested by nasal swabs; that non-living parts of the virus can still cause your immune system to overreact like the virus is still alive and reproducing in your body when it isn't really doing that; and the virus might not be present in your body any longer, but your immune system is stuck in the state of fighting it off. \n\nAdditionally, after becoming infected with different viruses, your body can take a while to heal. So even if you don't have the virus anymore, you may continue coughing and not be able to breathe as well as you normally do, since your throat and lungs have yet to fully heal and recover.\n\nCurrently, the majority of patients infected with COVID-19 have symptoms for several days - 6 weeks.\n\n\n",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "The incubation period of the virus is the time between the moment a person is exposed to the virus and when they first show symptoms. During this period, the virus is multiplying in the body, and once enough of the virus has been replicated, people may indeed show symptoms. However, some people may well be infected with the virus even if they don't have any symptoms. For people who are pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic, they may still spread the virus to others during this period of time.\n",
    "What our experts say": "According to current evidence, it is believed that people with no symptoms, who may be either asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic, are playing a major role in the transmission of COVID-19. That means symptom-based screening alone is unlikely to detect all of the infectious cases and control the transmission of COVID-19. The incubation period of COVID-19, which is the period between a person's exposure to the virus and the first sign of their symptoms (if they develop any at all), ranges from 5 to 14 days. Some people may be contagious during this 5-14 day incubation period before they have symptoms, making those cases \"pre-symptomatic\". The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has stated that 40% of COVID-19 cases are potentially spread by people who are pre-symptomatic. Other people infected with COVID-19 may never show symptoms at all and are called \"asymptomatic\". Asymptomatic people are still contagious throughout the time they are infected with the virus until their body clears it. The CDC estimates that 35% of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic.\n\nUPDATED: July 19, 2020: On July 10, 2020, the U.S. CDC has revised its estimates and now states they believe 40% of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic\n",

      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "In May 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci, an internationally-renowned medical expert and head of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, noted that he hoped that a vaccine would be available in the first half of 2021, 12-18 months after the virus that causes COVID-19 was first identified. On June 23, 2020, he stated that efforts are still on track to produce a vaccine by the end of 2020 or early 2021, which would be a record-breaking timeframe for vaccine development. \n\nThe rush for a COVID-19 vaccine is unprecedented in its speed, the number of labs and companies working to develop one, and the global pressure to develop a safe, effective vaccine on such a large scale. Prior to COVID-19, the shortest amount of time it took to develop a vaccine was for mumps and took roughly four years. Scientists have been working on a vaccine for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) for 20 years and still have yet to find a successful one. Because scientists discovered the genetic sequence of COVID-19 so rapidly, and so many groups are working around the clock to develop an effective vaccine, with unparalleled funding, the public health, medical, and pharmaceutical fields are hopeful to have a vaccine available much more quickly. Even after a vaccine is developed, adequate manufacturing, supply chain, and distribution networks also need to be coordinated in order to get the vaccine to people across the world.\n",
    "What our experts say": "The timeline for vaccine availability is still unclear, since the development and testing processes normally take many years. \n\nThere are currently more than 200 potential vaccines for COVID-19 under development around the world. Each potential vaccine must be thoroughly tested to determine whether it has any harmful side effects, whether it can prevent disease in other mammals, and whether it successfully produces antibodies, which are the biological tools or instructions our immune systems need to defend against the virus. \n\nScientists also need to assess how the immune system responds to the vaccine in general, which takes time. Even with an expedited timeline and regulatory approval process, researchers must ensure adequate clinical testing and adherence to regulatory standards, manufacturing, and quality control processes. Given the high rate at which possible vaccines drop off during the testing process, and potential manufacturing constraints, it will be difficult to produce, test, and scale a vaccine before 2021. \n",

    "Question": "What do we know so far about COVID-19 and nursing homes?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Transmission",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & nursing homes",
    "Background and context": "Since the earliest outbreaks in the United States occurred in nursing care homes for the elderly, much speculation has surrounded older populations as they are high-risk for the virus. In addition, nursing home residents remain in enclosed spaces, are sometimes in close confines with others, and often have preexisting conditions, so their risk increases. In fact, in 14 states in the U.S., nursing home residents and staff who have died from COVID-19 account for more than half of all COVID-19 deaths in that state.\n\nIn response to this, most countries with large populations of people over 65 have created new regulations to make sure that patient, employee, and healthcare worker safety in these facilities is the highest priority. By using these new standards, the risks should be significantly reduced for residents and employees alike. \n",
    "What our experts say": "The risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is particularly high in nursing homes, which cater to vulnerable older adults who often have chronic illnesses or underlying conditions. A nursing home in Kirkland, Washington was one of the first hotspots for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States: the facility accounted for 30 out of the 46 deaths in Washington due to COVID-19 at the time. Since then, there have been several outbreaks in nursing homes across the United States, including in Montana and Utah, as of July 2020. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control also found that long-term nursing care facilities were vulnerable to outbreaks long before the COVID-19 pandemic: 80% of the 2,590 non-foodborne outbreaks of norovirus in the US from 2009 to 2012 were attributed to long-term care facilities.\n\nNursing home residents are vulnerable to severe complications and mortality from COVID-19, and residents often live close to one another, which makes it challenging to implement quarantine and social distancing measures. Close proximity to caregivers who assist multiple residents across different rooms in the facility can also contribute to transmission of the virus, especially if infection prevention control measures are inadequate. Many staff lack access to paid sick leave, which may incentivize them to work even while experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. \n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)  recommends encouraging long-term care facility or nursing home workers to stay home if they are sick, screen workers and residents regularly for symptoms of COVID-19, adhere to U.S. CDC visitation guidelines, maintain at least 6 feet / 2m between workers, visitors, and residents, stagger breaks to prevent overcrowding, and provide hand washing facilities and alcohol-based hand sanitizer throughout the nursing home, among other measures. The U.S. CDC further recommends improvements in reporting COVID-19 cases from nursing home facilities, assigning at least one individual trained in infection and prevention control (IPC) to manage IPC on-site, screen visitors upon entry, and limit visitors (especially if they are experiencing symptoms), and create a robust testing plan for all employees and residents of the nursing home. There should also be guidelines in place to dedicate a separate unit of the nursing home to care for known or suspected COVID-19 patients to prevent further transmission. Visitation requirements can be tightened or relaxed depending on the number of cases in the community: the U.S. CDC recommends use of alternative methods such as video conferencing in lieu of in-person visits. Preventive measures include restricting all visitors except for compassionate care reasons, such as end-of-life care.\n",

    "Question": "Is there a cure for COVID-19? What is the cure?\n",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Treatment",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & treatments",
    "Background and context": "The word 'cure' is a broad one that technically means a procedure or drug that ends a certain medical condition, and implies a complete restoration of health. The word 'treatment,' on the other hand, technically means a procedure or drug that improves a certain medical condition, but doesn't necessarily end it. This distinction is important because there is currently no cure for COVID-19, but there are treatments in use, namely Remdesivir, which is under emergency use authorization (EUA) by the U.S. FDA, and Dexamethasone, which was previously approved by the FDA to treat a range of other health conditions. None of these treatments, however, are officially approved for COVID-19. There are multiple studies being conducted around the world to test a variety of cures, treatments, and preventative vaccines for COVID-19.\n",
    "What our experts say": "As of July 29, 2020, there is no known cure for COVID-19, but there are ways to manage the symptoms of the disease. Healthcare professionals around the world are researching various treatments for COVID-19, including drugs that already exist to treat other conditions to see if they may be effective against COVID-19 as well.\n\nNo treatments are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for COVID-19, but because COVID-19 is a public health crisis, doctors can treat patients using some drugs that are not technically approved for COVID-19. Emergency use authorization enables unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used for diagnosis, treatment or prevention in an emergency setting, even if the treatments may still be under further study.\n\nRemdesivir, an antiviral drug manufactured by Gilead Sciences that stops the virus from replicating, received emergency use authorization by the U.S. FDA. It reportedly reduced the recovery time for hospitalized patients from 15 days to 11 days, and early results indicate that it may reduce mortality among patients who are very sick from COVID-19. \n\nIn terms of clinical management of symptoms, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 treatment guidelines indicate that Remdesivir supplies are limited and should be prioritized for patients who need it most (hospitalized patients who require supplemental oxygen). The guidelines also recommend the use of dexamethasone, a steroid that can reduce inflammation, for patients who require ventilators or supplemental oxygen. Healthcare professionals use ventilators and supplemental oxygen to ensure that hospitalized patients have a healthy supply of oxygen in the body, and monitor patients accordingly. At present, there is no other cure for COVID-19.\n",

    ],
    "Background and context": "The outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States was first reported in long-term care facilities, also called nursing homes, in Washington state in February 2020. These early outbreaks involved people over the age fo 65, often with underlying health conditions like heart disease or breathing problems, which means the COVID-19 risks faced by these groups were numerous. Additionally, nursing homes are housed in enclosed buildings and have staff members that care for multiple residents making these facilities excellent hosts for viral spreading. Shortly before February, staff members and the family members of nursing home residents traveled often around the country and internationally and were not self-isolating since the United States had not had a substantial outbreak at this time. This likely allowed cases to spread rapidly from staff and family members to residents of nursing homes.\n\nIn response to these early nursing home outbreaks, several government agencies that oversee these facilities and the nursing homes themselves created stricter policies to prevent the future spread of the virus. Since then, conditions have improved in many facilities, but more research needs to be completed to completely understand the reasons for these initial outbreaks.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on July 29, 2020_\n",
    "What our experts say": "Nursing homes, like long-term care facilities, are uniquely vulnerable to COVID-19 transmission. COVID-19 is like many other respiratory viruses and can easily be transmitted between people in enclosed spaces. This is why we consider these facilities high risk for transmission. \nSince many residents at nursing homes have preexisting conditions (i.e. heart disease or breathing problems) they are at a greater risk for severe disease if they get COVID-19. \nMore research has shown that COVID-19 infections were common in nursing homes, for both residents and staff, as nursing homes often do not have enough resources dedicated to infection prevention like guidelines to follow, dedicated staff members, and specific equipment. In addition, the shared living spaces like cafeterias and group rooms make it hard to isolate patients. Nursing homes are vulnerable areas for COVID-19 transmission. \n\n_This entry was updated with new information on July 29, 2020._\n",

    "Question": "What is the difference between exposure and infection to a virus?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background and context": "We are exposed to viruses, chemicals, sunlight, and many other things every day. In general, exposure suggests that someone has been in an area where they may have come into contact with a foreign substance called a pathogen (a virus, bacteria, or other tiny organism) that can cause a disease. In the case of COVID-19, the pathogen is a respiratory virus. \n\nAn infection happens when a pathogen that causes an illness gets into our body (i.e. lungs, skin, eyes, throat, stomach, blood). A virus may enter the body through contact with mucous membranes. These membranes are tissues in the body that line parts of your ear, eyes, nose, throat, digestive tract and other parts of the body that are exposed to air like wounds on the skin. Once the virus enters the body, it enters into cells and is able to spread and cause inflammation. Inflammation causes a person to develop symptoms of infection. Common symptoms of COVID-19 infection include fever, fatigue, cough, and shortness of breath. But scientists are discovering new symptoms associated with COVID-19 every day.\n\nFor COVID-19, some people who are exposed to the virus never become infected. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that there is an increased risk of infection for people who are exposed to the virus by being in close contact (within 6 feet or about 2 meters for 15 minutes or longer) with an infected person. The time between exposure to the virus and the appearance of symptoms of infection is currently being studied by many researchers, but we are still learning about this process. For people who become ill with COVID-19, research has shown that symptoms of infection usually begin about five days after someone is exposed to the virus, and 97.5% of people who are exposed to the virus will show symptoms within 11.5 days.\n",
    "What our experts say": "When it comes to infectious diseases, \"exposure\" means coming into contact with a virus or bacteria. Infection happens when someone is exposed and actually becomes sick from the exposure. Exposure does not always lead to an infection. If the time a person is exposed to the virus is very short, if the amount of virus that enters the body is not in a large enough quantity, or if the body's immune system is able to quickly fight it off, then exposure will be less likely to lead to infection. \n\nMany things have to happen for an exposure to result in an infection, especially the ways in which a person was exposed to the virus. In the case of the virus that causes COVID-19, exposure takes place usually by breathing in the virus through the nose or the mouth, and sometimes the virus enters our bodies through the eyes. People can be \"exposed\" to different viruses in different ways, such as by eating food with a virus on it, or getting bit by a mosquito or other animal that carries a virus. Again, in the case of COVID-19, exposure typically happens by breathing in the virus through the nose or the mouth.\n\nOther factors that can impact whether an exposure leads to an infection include whether the germ is a virus, a bacteria or a parasite; how strong or \"infectious\" it is; and the strength of our body defense system (immune system). \n\nFor example, you could be exposed to whooping cough (pertussis) by someone in the same room as you, but whether or not you end up being infected depends on several factors. These factors include how close to the person you were, how long you were exposed for, and if you are vaccinated against whooping cough.\n",

    "Question": "How can I protect myself if I am attending a protest or mass gathering?",

    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & protests",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Protests and mass gatherings take place outdoors, which means in principle that the outdoor air can dilute the virus and reduce the risk of inhaling the virus with each breath. However, in practice, attending protests and mass gatherings still carry a significant risk of COVID-19 transmission. This is because when attending a protest it can be hard to practice social distancing (being 6 feet apart from one another) and that people can be speaking and shouting while standing close to one another, increasing the risk of transmission. In addition, tear gas and pepper spray are often used in protests to break up crowds. These can cause people to tear up and remove their masks to cough a lot, because of trouble breathing. These actions both increase respiratory secretions from the eyes, nose and mouth, further increasing the risk of COVID-19 transmission.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Attending protests or mass gatherings can increase the risk of catching COVID-19 or spreading the disease. This is especially so given the large amount of people who are infected with COVID-19 but do not have any symptoms (pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic), and may feel well enough to attend a mass gathering like a protest or march. In this context, there are a few steps you can take to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. These include first of all wearing a mask and trying to maintain a certain distance from other people at the protest - 6 feet (or 2 m) where possible. Additionally, wearing heat resistant gloves and eye protection (ex: sunglasses) is also recommended. Since yelling - even through a mask - can increase the spread of respiratory droplets due to the force that pushes them out, it is recommended to choose signs or drums (or similar noise makers) if you want to express a message. To prevent further spread of the virus, it is recommended to stick to a 'buddy group' when participating in protests to keep the number of close contacts low. In the event one person in the group is found to be infected with COVID-19, it will be easier to contact all the people who came into close contact with that person and take the recommended public health measures. Similarly, it is recommended for protesters to get tested if possible after taking part in protests. In the US, some states are offering free testing for protesters. Finally, make sure to carry hand sanitizer to disinfect your hands as much as needed and carry water to keep hydrated.\n\n\n",

Alum has, in some studies, shown the ability to kill bacteria, but has not shown efficacy against enveloped viruses like COVID-19.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Alum (also called potassium alum or aluminum potassium sulfate) has been widely used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food, and even textiles, but it has not been tested against viruses. While alum has some antimicrobial and anti fungal properties, it has not been shown to be an effective alternative for sanitizer or disinfectants. It is possible that there might be research, in the future, regarding the use of alum as an anti-viral disinfectant and cleaner, but the current literature does not support its use as an alternative to those on the EPA List N disinfectants with claims against Emerging Viral Pathogens.\n",

    "Question": "Can someone get reinfected and get COVID-19 a second time?",
    "Status": "Update ready for review",
    "Category": "Reinfection",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & Reinfection",
    "Background and context": "As scientists, public health professionals, and doctors monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, they continue to learn about how the virus spreads, its symptoms, and other factors important to diagnosis, testing, monitoring, and long-term public health planning. The possibility of reinfection continues to be a prominent news headline with healthcare professionals reporting that some patients who had fully recovered from the virus later redeveloped symptoms. Some case reports detail how both symptom monitoring and testing have been performed, and, in some instances, patients have documented recovery of COVID-19 with negative virus test results only to become ill and test positive weeks or months later. \n\nWhile there are still many aspects of the virus and the pandemic that are unknown, recent research suggests that reinfection may be possible. Newer research shared with a preprint release on July 11th, 2020 found that COVID-19 antibodies function similarly to those from other coronaviruses that are associated with common colds. While the number of antibodies is higher in patients with more severe illness, reports suggest that the protective antibodies decrease relatively quickly (sometimes within 60 days)- especially in patients who had a mild case of COVID-19. Similarly, a population-based study from Spain examined antibodies of more than 50,000 people with possible exposure early in the pandemic and found that very few people have maintained antibodies to date- even those who lived in areas significantly impacted by the virus. Finally, a study done in primates (not humans) showed that COVID-19 immunity was maintained for 28 days following the original infection, but the study did not include longer range measures and, as an animal study, may not be directly comparable to humans.\n\nIt is important to note that, unlike other viruses, the number of antibodies needed to prevent reinfection with COVID-19 is unknown as is the level of antibodies needed to suggest that someone is “immune” to the virus. Studies to further understand immunity as well as the possibility for reinfection are ongoing.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Scientists do not know for sure if people can become infected with COVID-19 a second time, but it may be possible. More evidence is needed to determine whether or not reinfection can occur in patients and what kind of immunity to the virus people might obtain once they have been infected. We are still learning a lot about what kind of natural defense - also known as immunity - a person has after being infected with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. As of now, there has only been one documented case of reinfection: a 33-year old man in Hong Kong who had two infections over a period of 4-5 months. Though the study describing the man and his potential reinfections has been accepted by the scientific journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, it has not yet been published so other scientific experts have not been able to rigorously study the data or full results of the paper. This patient's apparent infections were from different strains of COVID-19 and while the first caused mild symptoms, the second infection did not cause the patient to have any symptoms. This might mean that patients do not have lifelong immunity to the virus and if any immunity does exist after someone is infected with the virus, it is not known for how long or how strong that immunity is. This is why it is important for all people to continue using prevention measures like wearing masks and social distancing in order to stop the spread of the virus.\n\nIn terms of other potential cases of reinfection, in some cases some patients have tested positive a second time for the virus but scientists think that this is most likely residual viral RNA (traces of the virus left in the body) that is being detected by very sensitive tests or through false-positive tests. As we learn more about long-term immunity and protection from re-infection, this could change, but currently we haven't seen published cases to support that it is occurring. For those concerned about antibody tests - tests used to determine whether or not a person was infected with COVID-19 in the past - it is important to note that a lack of antibodies several months after infection might not mean the person has no immunity against the virus and is susceptible to infection again. \n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 25, 2020_\n",

    "Category": "Risks",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & cancer survivors",
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Despite the fact that people who have been cancer-free for five years might have previously had compromised immune systems, once this amount of time has passed since their treatments, their  immune system will hopefully mostly or fully have recovered. Generally, cancer survivors with no other preexisting conditions do not have a greater risk of catching the illness than the general population, but every person and their previous treatments are different, and survivors should always talk to their doctors about their health. \n\nSince most COVID-19 research regarding cancer is being done on people currently undergoing treatment, not much is known about people who do not actively have cancer. In general, the more time that has passed since end of treatments, the better, since immune system function can be rebuilt more over several years as opposed to a few months. As our knowledge about cancer and COVID-19 continues to evolve, we will learn more about immune system functions and how previous treatments might impact people's potential risks for becoming infected with the virus.\n",
    "What our experts say": "The majority of cancer survivors, who have been cancer-free for at least five years, are likely to have normal immune system functions and are not at an increased risk for COVID-19. However, every body is different so every cancer survivor should speak with a doctor who knows their full medical history and can discuss their personal risks with them.\n\nFor some cancer survivors, their previous treatments might impact their risk of getting COVID-19 or having a severe form of the disease, as these treatments can have long term effects on the immune system and cause the survivor to have preexisting conditions that may put them at a higher risk for viral infection. For example, patients who have undergone a bone marrow transplant (also known as a 'stem cell transplant') might not regain a completely functional immune system as the transplant depletes their white blood cell system (which the body then replaces). Some patients who have undergone bone marrow transplants are no longer immune to illnesses they had become immune to before the procedure. These patients can be at risk for a number of infections, including COVID-19, but the longer it has been since treatment, the more time your body's immune system has had to improve.\n\nDespite not having a higher risk of becoming infected with the virus than the general population, it should be noted that cancer survivors do have a higher risk of complications if they become infected with COVID-19. This group is also more likely to be hospitalized if they are infected, compared to people who have never had cancer before. To protect themselves from the virus, just like the general population, cancer survivors should use protective measures like wearing masks, maintaining at least six feet of distance, staying home when they can, and washing hands thoroughly and often.\n",

    "What our experts say": "In combination with hand washing and social distancing measures, it is important to wear masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19 because the virus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets released when people speak, cough, sneeze or sing. Some infected people may not appear ill or may develop symptoms at a later time, but they can still spread the virus without symptoms. Masks prevent people from spreading the virus to others, especially when we can't be 6 ft / 2m apart. Cloth masks primarily protect people in close proximity to the person wearing the mask by trapping droplets that are released from the wearer. Cloth masks can also protect the wearer by filtering out some virus particles trying to enter. \nMedical masks (N95 or FFP2) filter virus particles from entering more effectively than cloth masks and are designed to protect the wearer. Supplies of those are limited and generally reserved for doctors.\n",

Proper use of PPE can help reduce the spread of COVID-19. Wearing PPE is a risk reduction measure that lowers the chances of getting infected or infecting someone else, but does not eliminate the risk completely. Hand washing and physical distancing (min of 6 feet / 2 metres) are still recommended. \n\nIn the U.S., the government recently warned that they did not issue or endorse fraudulent flyers being circulated about mask use under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). People are encouraged to follow official ADA guidance, which is available at http://ADA.gov, +1-800-514-0301 (voice), and +1-800-514-0383 (TTY). While the U.S. does not currently have a national level policy around the use of masks, an increasing number of cities, counties, and states have passed policies known as \"mask mandates\" that require people to wear masks in certain public settings. Medical exemptions for wearing masks under these policies can be checked with the responsible government offices.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Wearing masks or other face coverings can help slow the spread of COVID-19. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) recommends wearing masks, except for children under 2 years old, and anyone who has trouble breathing, anyone who is unconscious or incapacitated, and anyone who is unable to remove a mask without help. \n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), which enforces the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), there is no \"blanket exemption to people with disabilities from complying with legitimate safety requirements necessary for safe operations,” including mask policies set by businesses and local governments. The ADA does require that people with disabilities are “reasonably accommodated,” such as by finding alternative public health measures for people who cannot safely wear and breathe through a mask.\n",

    "Question": "Can convalescent plasma help treat COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Update ready for review",
    "Background and context": "Using convalescent plasma from individuals who were previously infected to treat sick individuals has been in practice for nearly 100 years for several diseases including polio, influenza, and Ebola. Plasma is the liquid portion of the blood and contains disease-specific antibodies that helped fight the infection in a recovered individual, and that may help fight the infection in a newly infected recipient. As a result, convalescent plasma is being explored as an option for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.\n\nIn March 2020, the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) announced an emergency investigational process to allow doctors to treat serious cases with convalescent plasma. In April 2020, the U.S. FDA announced a National Expanded Access Protocol through the Mayo Clinic that expanded convalescent plasma treatment to include adults at risk of severe disease in addition to adults with severe cases. In August 2020, the U.S. FDA announced an emergency use authorization that authorizes the distribution of COVID-19 convalescent plasma in the U.S. and its administration by healthcare providers to treat hospitalized patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Additionally, a number of clinical trials are underway to study the efficacy of convalescent plasma in preventing or treating COVID-19 in a range of cases. \n\nMore research is still necessary to determine if convalescent plasma is effective and safe as a treatment for COVID-19. Scientists are working to identify whether it might help reduce severity of illness, shorten the duration of illness, or even prevent death associated with COVID-19.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 25, 2020_\n",
    "What our experts say": "When someone has been infected with COVID-19, their body's immune system produces substances called antibodies that work to destroy the virus. These antibodies can usually be found in the blood of people after they recover from the virus, specifically in the liquid portion of the blood called 'plasma.' Because the antibodies in plasma helped the infected person fight off the virus and improve their health, researchers are studying whether or not transferring plasma from patients who have recovered or are almost fully recovered (also called 'convalescent') to patients currently infected with the virus can help their immune systems fight off the infection as well.\n\nThis experimental use of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 is not an approved treatment by the World Health Organization or the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but there is some indication that it might be beneficial in the early stages of a COVID-19 infection. On August 23, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for investigational convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients, based on their assessment that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks. This means COVID-19 convalescent plasma is now regulated as an investigational product, but it not yet U.S. FDA approved for use.\n\nMore research needs to be conducted before scientists reach a consensus about the benefits as well as negative impacts plasma may have in infected patients.\n\n_This entry was updated with new information on August 25, 2020._\n",

    "Question": "How effective is spraying disinfectants in public places in curbing the spread of infection? ",
    "Status": "Needs + Editing",
    "Background and context": "In some countries, measures have been taken to spray disinfectants into the air (both indoors and outdoors) or onto people to prevent virus spread. While widespread spraying has been effective at controlling illnesses spread by mosquitos (i.e. West Nile virus, dengue) or other insects, SARS-Cov-2 is spread directly from person to person. While disinfectants do kill SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, most experts agree that widespread spraying is likely ineffective in preventing virus spread. Spraying disinfectants into the air will not prevent virus spread from person to person via respiratory droplets (from coughing, sneezing, or talking).  Because the SARS-Cov-2 virus lives within the body, spraying disinfectants onto people or encouraging people to gargle or drink disinfectants is also ineffective and can be very dangerous.  In addition, spraying can cause breathing problems, skin irritation, burns, environmental pollution, and may be harmful to fish, birds, and other animals. Social distancing, face mask use, disinfecting “high touch” surfaces (i.e. door handles, handrails), and careful hand-washing are recommended to help prevent virus spread.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Transmission of COVID-19 from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented, but it is possible that the reason for this is due to gaps in research and contact tracing._ _There is limited research about the effectiveness of disinfecting public spaces, but researchers are working to determine whether or not spraying disinfectant will impact the amount of virus transmissions that occurs from people coming into contact with objects like water fountains, playground equipment, and hand rails. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still states that thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting indoor surfaces in public places is a best practice for preventing the spread of COVID-19. As it is possible to spread the virus through contaminated surfaces, thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting all surfaces - not just spraying disinfectant - that humans touch in both public and private settings. \n\nHowever, it should be noted that spraying disinfectants in public places may be harmful to humans as exposure to disinfectant sprays can cause dangerous respiratory effects when inhaled. Other potential impacts are skin and eye irritation, potential corrosion, and some disinfectants might have a chemical (formaldehyde) that is known to cause cancer. Lastly, some chemical disinfectants are flammable, explosive, can generate toxic gases, and can potentially be harmful to the environment, so serious caution should be taken when spraying any of these disinfectants to large surface areas or for a prolonged period of time.\n",

    "Question": "What do we know so far about \"COVID toes\"?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Fact-checking organization"
    ],
    "Background and context": "There have been many reports of new and emerging symptoms linked to COVID-19 throughout the evolution of the pandemic. As healthcare professionals continue to learn about the virus and its presentation, classifying symptoms according to their severity and frequency has become important in making accurate and timely diagnoses. While the most common symptoms of COVID-19 are breathing problems, fever, coughing, and fatigue, other symptoms of infection have also been identified and include nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, sore throat, loss (or absence) of smell or taste, and muscle aches. \n\nAnother symptom that has been occasionally reported is a discoloration (a slightly purple or pink color) or bumpy rash on the toes, feet, or hands- commonly referred to as “COVID toes.” Reports have continued to suggest that “COVID toes” are fairly uncommon, though they may occur more often in younger, asymptomatic patients. Healthcare professionals often suggest that patients contact their doctors for any unusual symptoms that they experience, and patients should seek medical care and coronavirus testing if they experience symptoms common to coronavirus infection.\n",
    "What our experts say": "\"COVID toes\" typically refers to purple or pink discoloration, often with small, raised bumps on the skin on the tips of the toes and, in some instances, on the hands. Current research on the symptom is still evolving, and the exact cause of the symptom remains unclear. It is also important to note that multiple of the reports published about \"COVID toes\" are not based on patients having positive laboratory test results for COVID-19. The association with COVID-19 in these reports is based on the patients self-reporting COVID-19 symptoms or reporting having been in close proximity with someone diagnosed with COVID-19.\nThe appearance of \"COVID toes\" and other symptoms can vary from patient to patient, and a dermatologist or clinician should be consulted for better clarity and safety in diagnosis. As of now, it is not clear what makes some people infected with COVID-19 have this reaction to the virus. It is not clear when in the course of illness the discoloration and rashes are most likely to be observed, and some reports suggest that these symptoms may occur more commonly in people without other typical symptoms of COVID-19.\n",

    "Question": "Why has Iceland had fewer deaths of COVID-19 than other countries?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background and context": "Media reports suggest that Iceland successfully “beat” coronavirus or “eliminated” the case curve that many countries have been taking measures to flatten. Unlike many countries, early planning and preparedness was instituted to ensure that the country was able to track and trace anyone possibly exposed to an infected person. Iceland began preparing for COVID-19 before any cases had been reported in the country. By employing law enforcement officers, nurses, and a criminologist, the team was able to use their skills as detectives to track both people and the virus once the first case was identified. As cases increased, the tracing team also increased and included epidemiologists, physicians, and other health professionals; and the country expanded testing to the highest per-capita rate in the world. Though Iceland did not ever institute a lockdown, individuals who were exposed and infected had to quarantined and some types of business were closed (i.e. night clubs, hair salons).\n",
    "What our experts say": "Iceland, a country with 365,000 people has registered 10 deaths from COVID-19, prompting many analyses and news articles over its success in containing the pandemic. Iceland has a small population spread over a very large geography, with hundreds of miles of the Atlantic Ocean separating it from the rest of the Nordic region. This gives it a natural advantage in fighting an infectious disease like COVID-19 that spreads through people, and whose transmission increases exponentially in high density areas. \nIn addition, Iceland took very rapid decisions to respond to the virus on its territory and prevent infections transmission, as soon as they observed the pandemic unfolding in China and Europe, even before cases were registered in Iceland. Hospitals were testing people arriving from abroad for a month before the first confirmed case in Iceland, and a media campaign urged hand washing and social distancing. The country put early restrictions on nursing homes to protect vulnerable segments of the population, and also closed high schools and universities. When cases were declared in Iceland and increasing at a fast rate, Iceland implemented very rigorously the test-trace-isolate strategy of containing infectious diseases. All contacts of confirmed cases were located and ordered to quarantine themselves for 14 days. Their policy of testing and tracking to find and isolate infected people, was comprehensive as it was not limited only to people experiencing symptoms but also to asymptomatic people. Their extensive contact tracing effort relied on teams on a large number of people mobilized, including nurses, police officers and health care professionals. \nIceland was able to test such large numbers of people, thanks to a partnership with a private sector company named [deCODE Genetics][1], based in Reykjavik, Iceland.\n\n  [1]: https://www.decode.com/\n",

    "Question": "Does wearing a mask for long periods of time affect the brain causing lethargy, headache, and dizziness because of lack of oxygen?",
    "Status": "Needs context",
    "What our experts say": "The claim that the prolonged use of face masks can cause oxygen deficiency, carbon dioxide intoxication, dizziness, or other health challenges is not grounded in science. Science shows that the risks associated with wearing masks are generally minimal, and the benefits plenty. Even if a person is wearing an airtight medical grade mask, like an N95 or FFP2 mask, the risks of lethargy, headache, and dizziness are low, even after several hours. For the average person wearing a cloth or surgical mask, there is even less risk of these symptoms occurring as they still allow oxygen to flow out of the mouth and nose freely. While it might feel like breathing is more difficult in a mask and you are not getting enough air, that is likely a response to stress or anxiety from wearing the mask and can usually be helped by focusing on normal breathing patterns. Shallow breathing, hyperventilation, and breath holding can cause increases in carbon dioxide which leads to headaches and nausea. These symptoms are generally not caused by the use of masks. \n",

    "Question": "What does it mean if the virus is reactivated?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Background and context": "There are multiple reports of patients around the world who have seemed to recover from coronavirus but later return for care with milder symptoms and test positive again. It is not currently known if cases like these are patients with an infection that was never truly gone, a “reinfection” from a new source or exposure, or a virus reactivation that could occur if the virus was “dormant” in cells or tissues in the body. Some of the suspected cases of reactivation or reinfection have also been suggested to occur as a result of faulty testing resulting in false-positive or false-negative results.  International studies of patients with possible reinfection or reactivation are ongoing.\n",
    "What our experts say": "The reactivation of a virus is rare but can potentially happen when a person who was infected no longer has symptoms and is considered recovered, but might still have very small amounts of the virus in their bodies that are considered \"sleeping\" or dormant. This can also be called the latent phase of a virus where virus particles are no longer made and a person doesn't feel ill any longer. Even though the person who was infected hasn't been shedding the virus or spreading the virus to other people, a number of events can happen (like a sudden onset of stress) that can cause the virus to \"wake up\" or reactivate. This can cause symptoms to return and the person can spread infections to others during this time. This is most commonly seen in viruses like the Herpes Simplex Virus. For COVID-19, there have been no studies published that have determined whether or not this virus can become reactivated or can be considered a \"sleeping virus\" that can reinfect a recovered patient.\n\nThough it is early in the global understanding of the virus, recent small studies have suggested that patients who retest positive are not currently infected with coronavirus.  In these cases, reports suggest that the diagnostic tests have detected noninfectious or dead viruses and reported a positive result.\n",

    "Question": "If there is no cure for COVID-19, what are people getting treated for in hospitals?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background and context": "People who are admitted to the hospital need care that cannot be provided at home or in a clinic—whether or not there is a cure or specific treatment for their illness. While hospitalized patients may have had surgery to fix a broken bone, or may be given medicines to cure a bacterial infection or kill cancer cells, other therapies are given to patients to help them feel better even though they cannot cure the illness that actually causes their symptoms. For example, supportive care may include things like oxygen or special inhaled medications to help patients breathe better, fluids given intravenously to prevent or treat dehydration, or medications to decrease inflammation or fever. All of these therapies are commonly used in the hospital, but they are not designed to cure a patient of an infection, cancer, or other condition.\n",
    "What our experts say": "People with severe COVID-19 illness often require medical care due to the symptoms they experience, like trouble breathing, chest pressure, fatigue, etc. While there is no specific treatment or cure for COVID-19, as it is a new viral infection, people are receiving supportive treatment to help them recover, though some people eventually die as a result of the virus. Supportive treatment is treatment that helps to alleviate the symptoms caused by an illness but can't actually cure the illness itself. Supportive care gives symptoms relief while the infection naturally subsides over time, at which point the symptoms diminish greatly and patients can go back home. Examples of this include giving oxygen to a patient, injecting steroids to reduce inflammation, giving ventilation to help them breathe, and other necessary medical interventions that do not stop the virus but do treat the more severe symptoms.\n",

    "Question": "What is the best measure (cases, hospitalizations or deaths) for measuring the level of infection in a community?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Transmission",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & epidemiology",
    "Background and context": "There are many numbers and statistical values that are commonly in the news to show how well countries are doing at managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Some countries are reporting very high numbers of infected people (cases) and some are reporting very high numbers of deaths. \n\nIf we were to compare two groups (Group A and Group B) that each had 1,000 deaths, at a glance, the numbers may appear similar.  If we were to find out, however, that Group A had 10,000 people with the virus and 1,000 died, that would mean that 10% of those infected in the population had died. If Group B had 100,000 people with the virus and 1,000 died, that would mean that 1% of those infected in the population had died.  The difference between Group A and Group B is much more significant when viewed this way; the patients in Group A were far more likely to die than those in Group B.\n\nThough there is scientific evidence that suggests that older people or those with existing medical conditions like diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure are at higher risk of becoming infected and seriously ill from COVID-19, genetics, dietary habits, and other factors may play an important role. True susceptibility to the virus is challenging to measure. Not everyone who is exposed to the virus becomes infected, and not everyone who is infected develops symptoms. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Ultimately, no single statistic or measurement can accurately indicate the state of a disease within a population. To best understand the level of infection in a community, all these numbers need to be looked at together. Until there is more routine testing to identify all infected patients (with or without symptoms), the risk of infection is likely to remain unclear.\n\nIn order to attempt to measure the level of infection in a community, we can look at the number of hospitalizations, the proportion of the population who has the disease at any given moment (period prevalence), or the number of new cases of disease over a given time interval (incidence rate). The number of COVID-19 deaths during a given period can provide an important snapshot to understand the impact of the virus, but it is not a very good measure of a population's risk of contracting the virus. \n\nTracking incidence rate is a more useful measure, because it helps us understand what proportion of an initially disease-free population develops the disease over a specified time period. This is a far more accurate measure of how likely a person in a population is to get infected compared to the number of deaths within a population.\n\nAdditionally, in trying to understand how the number of deaths vary between populations, it's best to compare the mortality rate (number of deaths in relation to the overall population), because simply looking at the number of deaths does not account for differences in the size of populations.\n",

    "Question": "Are children less susceptible to contracting the novel coronavirus?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Transmission",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & children",
    "Background and context": "As many countries struggle to determine if or when it may be safe to reopen schools, childcare centers, and playgrounds, researchers and scientists are still evaluating how likely children are to become ill from COVID-19 and how likely they are to spread the virus amongst one another, to other family members, or more broadly in the community. While current scientific evidence suggests that children are less likely to become as sick as adults, children are still able to become ill, may require hospitalization, and may die as a result of COVID-19. It is not clear why children are less likely than adults to become ill, but experts generally believe that differences are related to immunity - the body's natural defense mechanism whose function is to help fight infections.\n\nIf children do become infected with COVID-19, they may still spread the virus to parents or other adults at home, teachers at school, or other adults that they come into contact with in the community (i.e. churches, stores, social events). Children infected with the virus tend to have mild, cold-like symptoms (if they have symptoms at all), which caregivers may not recognize as COVID-19. In addition, they may not wash their hands enough or correctly, may not practice social distancing, may touch their faces often, and may not wear masks correctly (if they are over two years old and are able to wear masks). \n\nWhile scientific evidence does suggest that children with COVID-19 are less likely to become seriously ill than adults, experts argue that children alone cannot be considered when determining if or when it may be safe to open schools, childcare centers, and playgrounds. Ensuring safety for children, families, caregivers, teachers, and the community is important as scientists, doctors, and policy-makers consider further plans to respond to and plan for the next phases of the pandemic.\n",
    "What our experts say": "According to the Mayo Clinic in the U.S., children of all ages can catch the virus that causes COVID-19, but they do not become physically sick as often as adults. They are also less susceptible to experiencing severe side effects from the virus in comparison to older adults. However, some children do develop complications from COVID-19, such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), which is characterized by inflammation in different body parts, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. While MIS-C is rare, it can be deadly and remains poorly understood based on current research. \n\nSome evidence suggests that children may be less likely to contract the novel coronavirus, but it is still unclear whether this effect is due to limited interactions between children and hence fewer opportunities for transmission, or whether they are truly less susceptible to contracting the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) does not see a clear trend in the data yet, but large scale serological studies (studies that look at antibody presence in the blood) are currently underway and are likely to provide more clarity. Previous studies from Wuhan, China indicated that the virus was milder in children and transmission was fairly limited: a study of more than 72,000 cases by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that children under the age of 10 represented less than 1% of all cases. However, studies are ongoing to assess the level of susceptibility among children, and the evidence is still evolving.\n",

    "Question": "How easily does COVID-19 spread from contaminated surfaces or animals?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Transmission",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & contaminated surfaces",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "The public health community is continually learning about how the novel coronavirus spreads, and what transmission routes are most likely to make it spread. Because of this continual learning in the public health community, there has been public confusion around how easily SARS-CoV-2 spreads, and through which routes. \n\nConfusion is particularly centered around the virus spreading from touching an infected surface and the virus spreading from airborne transmission. Person-to-person spread is the most well understood form of transmission as well as the main transmission route for COVID-19. \n\nSuch confusion has led to debate around the need to wipe down groceries, wear gloves, avoid petting neighborhood animals, and other steps to mitigate surface transmission. Though surface transmission is not thought to be the main way SARS-CoV-2 spreads, it is still a risk and should be responded to with precaution. One way to think about it is that virus spread from person-to-person is direct transmission, whereas virus stemming from a surface requires two intermediaries: 1) touching the virus on a surface, and then right after 2) touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. One is more direct and therefore more common, but both require caution.\n\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention, COVID-19 doesn't easily spread from contaminated surfaces to humans. While it is not likely, it is still possible for the virus to spread through contaminated surfaces. \n\nRecent studies suggest that the more humid a region may be, the longer the virus may survive on surfaces. Another study found that the virus can remain on surfaces like plastic and steel for 48-72 hours, and for up to 24 hours on cardboard. If a person touches a contaminated surface with traces of the virus and then proceeds to touch their eyes, nose, or mouth, they could still become infected if the surface contains large amounts of the virus. Washing your hands for 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, and cleaning surfaces often is an important step in stopping the potential spread of the virus. The virus that causes COVID-19 primarily spreads through close, person-to-person contact, not through surface contamination, so continuing to maintain six feet (two meters) of distance, wearing a mask, and staying home as much as possible are the key steps in combatting the virus.\n\nThe risk of contracting the virus from the surfaces of animals and pets is also considered to be low. The U.S. CDC noted in June 2020 that there is currently no evidence that animals have a significant role in spreading COVID-19 and the risk of animals spreading it to humans is low. However, more studies are needed to determine if and how a variety of animals might be impacted by the virus.\n\n",

    "Question": "Why are smell tests being proposed over temperature checks at workplaces?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Testing",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & smell tests",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "There is growing interest in smell tests to supplement temperature testing during the current pandemic. Loss of smell, also called anosmia, is one of the possible symptoms of COVID-19. In some patients who have tested positive for COVID-19, loss of smell is the only reported symptom. The potential for a smell test serving as a better diagnostic for COVID-19 may lie in anosmia's unique link to COVID-19. Dr. Andrew Badley of the Mayo Clinic further explains this point as he stated “My impression is that anosmia is an earlier symptom of Covid-19 relative to fever, and some infected people can have anosmia and nothing else. So it’s potentially a more sensitive screen for asymptomatic patients.”\n\nAdditionally, temperature checks can be insufficient for screening because patients with COVID-19 may not have a fever, and there are other health conditions that can cause a fever. Loss of smell is more unique to COVID-19. While smell tests can be helpful to add to temperature screenings at workplaces, schools, airports, restaurants and other locations, it is important to remember that infected people can still transmit COVID-19 without showing any symptoms like fever or loss of smell.\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "While many businesses and public spaces have begun using temperature checks as a way to try to identify people who might be infected with COVID-19, several studies have proposed that using a smell test in addition to a thermometer check may be a more accurate way of detecting potential cases. The reasons for this are numerous, and are mostly due to concerns about the effectiveness of temperature checks. Some of these issues include:\n- The fact that many people with COVID-19 never develop any symptoms such as fevers;\n- People with fevers might not have the virus at all and could have any number of other illnesses;\n- Infrared/non-contact thermometers are often inaccurate and operating errors may occur; and\n- People who take over-the-counter medication for fevers might be ill but will not present with a fever.\nUsing a temperature check alone is not an effective strategy to detect COVID-19 infections at public sites. On the other hand, the potential benefits of a smell test are numerous, as the loss of smell— also called 'anosmia'—is relatively unique to COVID-19, whereas fevers are common symptoms in many illnesses. \n\nFor instance, a recent preprint study (awaiting peer-review) showed that COVID-19 patients were 27 times more likely to have lost their sense of smell than people without the virus, but only 2.6 times more likely to have fever or chills than those without the virus. Another study demonstrated that people with a loss of smell are \"more than 10 times more likely to have COVID-19 than other causes of infection,\" according to Dr. Carol Yan, making it a more accurate marker for COVID-19 than a fever would likely be, as they have many other causes and are associated with many other illnesses. Reasons like this are why many health experts believe that a combination of a smell test in addition to temperature checks could more accurately test and identify people for COVID-19.\n\n",

    "Question": "What does the science say about COVID-19 on surfaces?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Tranmission",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & surfaces",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Partner Organization"
    ],
    "Background and context": "The current science suggests that people most commonly become infected with COVID-19 through close contact with another infected person, even if the infected person is not showing symptoms. Close contact is when people are within about 6 feet (2 meters), and the infected person spreads the virus by coughing, sneezing, talking, or breathing into the close space.\n\nEven though the current science suggests that COVID-19 spreads most often through close personal contact, the public health community is continually learning about other ways that COVID-19 spreads. A major idea put forward is that COVID-19 could be spread from one person to another if the virus remains alive on surfaces like packages, food, plastic, or metals for long amounts of time, and that people touch their faces after having touched these surfaces. Multiple studies have analyzed how long the virus survives on different surfaces, and this evidence will continue to add to the understanding of the virus and how it is spread. This new evidence allows scientists to better understand whether or not people are likely to become infected by touching items in a market, collecting their mail or packages, or by contact with other surfaces in shared spaces (i.e. a table at a restaurant, a chair in an office) and public places (i.e. a bench at the park).\n",
    "What our experts say": "The virus that causes COVID-19 primarily spreads through close, person-to-person contact, not through surface contamination. However, the virus can live on surfaces and the amount of time that COVID-19 can survive on a surface depends on the material of the surface. According to recent studies, COVID-19 can survive from 3 hours to 7 days on surfaces, though the virus' lifespan varies greatly on different areas.\n\nIt should be noted that the amount of living virus that is on a surface decreases over time. In practice, the amount of the virus on a surface usually drops dramatically in the first few hours. It is also important to note that even though some of the living virus might still be detected on a surface after several hours or days, it might not be present in a large enough quantity to make someone sick.  \n\nAccording to The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine, the living virus could be detected on different surfaces for varying periods of time:\n\n• **Aluminum**: 2-8 hours\n• **Stainless steel**: 2-7 days\n• **Paper**: 3 hours\n• **Copper**: 4 hours\n• **Cardboard**: 24 hours\n• **Cloth**: 2 days\n• **Wood**: 4 days\n• **Plastic**: 3-7 days\n• **Metal:** 5 days\n• **Glass**: 5 days\n• **Paper money**: 4 days\n• **Face masks**: 7 days (**_Note:_**_ A small amount of viable virus was still present on the outside of the mask after 7 days, but masks should be frequently washed, sanitized, or be used only once._)\n\nIf a person touches a contaminated surface with traces of the virus and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth, they could become infected if the surface contains large amounts of the virus. This is why it is important to clean and disinfect any surfaces that people might come into contact with, especially those like doorknobs, cell phones, light switches, handles, countertops, sinks, toilets, and more. If possible, people should try to avoid touching high-contact surfaces in public. Washing your hands for 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, maintaining six feet (two meters) of distance and wearing a mask are key steps in combatting the spread of the virus.\n\n",

      "India"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Ayurveda is one of the world's oldest systems of traditional medicine. Since there is no approved treatment for COVID-19 yet, many people are turning to alternative or traditional medicine for answers. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of a major manufacturer of herbal products, Patanjali,  has claimed that the company has found an Ayurvedic cure for COVID-19. Patanjali claims that COVID-19 patients showed a 100% recovery rate when administered the Ayurvedic medicine known as 'Coronil,' which is comprised of a mixture of Tulsi, Giloy, and Ashwagandha. It is unclear whether this was a randomized controlled trial, and the company has claimed it conducted a clinical case study with \"hundreds of positive patients,\" which showed \"100 percent favorable results.\" The clinical trials were claimed to have been conducted in two cities in India after securing regulatory approval last week. According to the press release, COVID-19 patients who were administered Ayurvedic medicine recovered in 2-14 days and tested negative for the virus, but no data has been released to the public yet.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Ayurveda is ancient Indian medical system that focuses on natural, holistic approaches to physical and mental health. Currently, there is no evidence to indicate that Ayurvedic medicine cures or prevents COVID-19. Similar claims for Ayurvedic cures have been made in the past for other infectious diseases with no known cure, such as HIV/AIDS, without any reliable evidence. Such bold claims should always be treated with caution. \nIn this particular case, the CEO of a major manufacturer of herbal products has claimed to have produced an Ayurvedic cure without providing any independent data to support these claims. While the company claims to have tested hundreds of patients in a \"clinical case study\" which showed a 100% recovery rate, it is unclear whether any control group was included or whether the design of the study was strong enough to substantiate such claims. In addition, the company stated that all patients tested negative for the virus within 5-14 days after receiving the Ayurvedic medicine, but it is unclear how long each patient had the virus or were symptomatic. \nThe study also falsely claimed that Ayurvedic medicine is a cure for COVID-19 without disclosing how many patients were included in their research and how they can be sure that patients would not have tested negative naturally once the immune system fought off the infection over time. Ayurvedic medicine may be a helpful complement to Western medicine, and may not actively cause harm in some cases, but it should not be consumed as a cure for COVID-19. Instead, traditional prevention measures such as wearing masks and social distancing, should be followed to prevent infections.\n",

    "Question": "What do we know about the inflammatory syndrome impacting children with COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background and context": "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) warns that risks of severe COVID-19 illness tend to increase with age, with people over 85 being at highest risk for hospitalization, intensive care, ventilation, and potentially death. Tragically, the lives of young people, including children, have also been lost during the COVID-19 pandemic. More evidence is emerging on how some young patients develop severe symptoms and complications related to COVID-19. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a serious and potentially fatal condition in young people, which can appear similar to Kawasaki's disease. In mid-May 2020, the U.S. CDC asked doctors across the country to look out for MIS-C cases. In June 2020, another two studies found over 300 children with MIS-C in the United States, which was reported widely in the media. Researchers around the world continue to study why some children are seriously affected by COVID-19 when the majority of young people have had relatively mild cases.\n",
    "What our experts say": "The majority of young people infected have had relatively mild cases of COVID-19. However, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (U.S. CDC) recently identified the more severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) as a new syndrome associated with the virus that causes COVID-19. This inflammatory syndrome was first identified in April 2020 and is characterized by inflammation in different body parts, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. While MIS-C is rare, it can be deadly. Symptoms in children include fever, abdominal (gut) pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes, or fatigue. This is a newly identified condition that requires more research, but doctors have observed that symptoms can develop within four weeks of exposure to the novel coronavirus. The inflammation can be managed with medicines that can prevent damage to vital organs. MIS-C occurs in young people under 21, according to its case definition, although it is thought to mostly affect children between the ages of 2 to 15 and is not commonly reported in babies. The U.S. CDC recommends immediately contacting a doctor if your child exhibits any of the symptoms of the inflammatory syndrome. We still do not know why some children experience symptoms, while others do not, and it is unclear if children with particular health conditions are more likely to get MIS-C. At this point, the best prevention measures include taking all precautions to avoid contracting the novel coronavirus, including hand washing, social distancing, avoiding public gatherings, and wearing masks.\n",

    "Background and context": "Many models have been made available during the COVID-19 pandemic and can offer insight into peaks, impact of certain interventions, and other key predictors. Models are only as good as the data being used, the assumptions made, the parameters (constraints) put into place, and the continued updating of data to ensure the most recent and relevant information is available. The quality of the model impacts the accuracy of its predictions and as such, should be used as one of many resources in pandemic response and prevention. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Projection modeling is a mathematical way to use data to help predict a range of important COVID-19 outcomes, such as hospitalizations, infections and deaths. Modeling can also help determine how vaccinations or school closures, and the timing of these factors, may impact the disease outcomes.\n\nModeling researchers use datasets, mathematical approaches, and other parameters to predict the spread and dynamic of infectious diseases. Models can to help predict the number of future virus cases and the peaks and curves that are part of the course of the outbreak. Modeling is a great tool to help support decision-making but models are not able to predict the future, and they can fluctuate based on interventions like the use of social distancing and face masks, in the case of COVID-19. It is a helpful resource but should not be the sole source of information for guiding policy or interventions. \n",

    ],
    "Background and context": "Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Therefore, cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in households and community settings. In this context, disinfecting can be used to disinfect frequently touched surfaces (for example: tables, doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, toilets, faucets, sinks, and electronics). Disinfecting wipes are usually are wet wipes commercially available and containing chemicals, for example, EPA-registered disinfectants, or alcohol-based wipes (minimum 70% of alcohol) to kill germs on surfaces. However, transmission of COVID-19 occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through touching objects and surfaces, like doorknobs, countertops, keyboards, toys, etc. \n\n",
    "What our experts say": "Disinfectant wipes should never be reused. Reusing wipes will move germs from one surface to another, which is potentially harmful in the current pandemic. In order for any surface to be properly disinfected, the U.S. CDC recommends following the instructions on each product carefully and leaving the disinfectant on the surface for 3-5 minutes. This means the surface needs to be wet for this period of time, and you may need to use more than one disinfectant wipe depending on the size of the surface. However, you should never reuse the same disinfectant wipe.\n",

    "Background and context": "Vaccines are not medicines that can treat or cure diseases, as they are made for prevention. Vaccines contain a weakened, killed, or partial form of the same germs that cause the disease in order to stimulate the body's immune response to develop immunity without having to get sick. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that there are around 160 vaccines for COVID-19 in development as of July 6, 2020, with at least 21 vaccine candidates under clinical evaluation and 139 under pre-clinical evaluation. This includes U.K.'s Oxford University and AstraZeneca vaccine candidate that is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials with 5,000 people in Brazil and 4,000 people in the U.K., Australia's University of Queensland vaccine candidate that started phase one clinical trials with 120 people to be observed over 12 months (including a proportion of people assigned to receive a placebo for comparison), the U.S.'s Inovio Pharmaceuticals vaccine candidate that completed Phase 1 clinical trials with 40 people (reports suggest 94% had \"overall immune responses at week six after two doses\" and after eight weeks the vaccine candidate was considered \"safe and well-tolerated with no serious adverse events\"), and China's CanSino Biologics vaccine candidate that completed phase two clinical trials with 508 people and is planning to begin phase three clinical trials with 40,000 people from multiple countries.\n",
    "What our experts say": "COVID-19 vaccines are being developed to prevent people from getting the disease, not to treat or cure patients who already have the disease. Many experts continue to caution that a vaccine may not be widely available until the end of 2020 or beginning of 2021, which would already be record-breaking timing for vaccine development.\n\nRecently, Russia's Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University announced that they are completing human clinical trials of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 18 people vaccinated on June 18 (to be discharged on July 15) and 20 people vaccinated on June 23 (to be discharged on July 20). This is one of several human clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine candidates happening around the world, with some trials involving hundreds or thousands of people over observation periods of many months. Rigorous clinical trials are important to understand whether vaccine candidates are safe and without major negative side effects, as well as whether vaccine candidates are effective and can actually provide immunity for long periods of time.\n\nRussia's announcement of their human clinical trials has been accompanied by projections that the vaccine could be distributed in August and mass produced by private corporations in September. There are many challenges in scaling up from a vaccine candidate that has been tested on a few dozen people in one country to a commercially available vaccine that is available and suitable for millions of diverse people around the world. \n",

    "Question": "Is there a specific process through which COVID-19 enters the body? Does COVID-19 first enter through the throat before it \"destroys\" the lungs?",
    "Status": "Published",

    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & lungs",

      "Philippines"
    ],
    "Background and context": "As we learn more about COVID-19 and the way it is spread to humans, we will learn more about why the virus seems to impact the lungs of many people. Unlike most viruses humans come into contact with, COVID-19 is new, so humans have not had the ability to gradually build up their immune systems to defend themselves from the virus over time. This may be part of the reason why the virus continues to spread rapidly around the world and can cause significant symptoms in 20% of cases.\n",
    "What our experts say": "COVID-19 enters the body through the nose, mouth, and eyes. This happens primarily when someone infected with the virus releases small droplets of liquid that contain part of the virus through actions like coughing, sneezing, speaking, or singing. These small bits of virus range in size, from the wet, teardrop-sized types of droplets you might see when you sneeze, to microscopic ones that are so light and dry, they might remain in the air for hours. When a person is in close contact with these droplets, the virus enters the body through these three areas. Then, the virus lands at the back of the throat, also called the top of the upper respiratory tract, in roughly 80% of people who have mild cases of infection. For other more severe cases, the virus can then move down to the lungs, potentially causing pneumonia, which happens in 15-20% of cases, although most recover. \n\nWhen COVID-19 spreads to the lungs, it does not mean that they will be \"destroyed.\" It means that there is an infection involving fluid within tiny branches of air tubes or sacs in the lungs called 'alveoli.' These air sacs may fill up with so much liquid or pus that they become swollen, and their walls can thicken, so it is hard for oxygen to be processed and delivered through the lungs, making it harder to breathe. \n\nEvery virus has a different way of infecting humans, though many viruses gain entry into the body through the nose, mouth, and eyes and often cause upper respiratory infections like COVID-19.\n\n\n \n\n",

    "Question": "If COVID-19 is transmitted via airborne particles, how might testing change?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Aerosol/airborne transmission is not considered the main route for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, but it can happen and certain environments often support super spread events, like an indoor environment with poor ventilation. Since most of COVID-19 testing is based on symptoms and/or exposure to a person infected with COVID-19, expanding beyond these criteria to include individuals who were in certain environments where aerosol transmission might happen (e.g. a choir practice or fitness class), might mean more people will get tested. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Though the potential for airborne transmission likely wouldn't change testing methods outside of a push for more extensive testing in general, it might influence policy regarding mandating mask wearing, air purification and ventilation systems, and other methods of prevention related to airborne viral spread.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is not airborne in the traditional sense. COVID-19 spreads primarily through relatively large respiratory droplets that fall to the ground and into faces and bodies of others. These larger droplets, 'respiratory droplets,’ are wet from saliva and mucus and fall quickly to the ground. Scientists think this type of infectious droplet is how the majority of COVID-19 infections spread. \n\nOn the other hand, examples of airborne diseases are tuberculosis and measles, and the way these diseases spread is primarily through the air in smaller particles called 'microdroplets' or 'droplet nuclei.' Smaller droplets can stay in the air for longer periods of time because they are so small and light. Exhalation, talking, coughing, and singing can cause these small droplets to linger in the air for hours after a person leaves a room. SARS-CoV-2 viral particles may be part of these tiny droplets, and can travel beyond 6 feet (2m) in certain situations, but the disease is still not understood to be transmitted primarily through lingering infectious particles in the air. \n\nThe aerosol or airborne transmission of COVID-19 occurs more indoors in close contact. This might mean that people who don't fall into the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-defined category of \"exposed\" to the virus (within 6 feet or 2m of an infected person for more than 15 minutes), but were in the same room as an infected person for an extended period of time, may now be considered ‘exposed’ and require testing.\n\nThere is currently some controversy around this topic, as 239 scientists recently sent a letter to the World Health Organization (WHO) urging them to recognize the potential of people catching the virus from droplet nuclei via airborne transmission. These scientists believe that the evidence supporting the concept of airborne transmission mean current procedures like social distancing and vigorous hand-washing do not provide enough protection from virus-carrying microdroplets that can stay suspended in the air for hours. Thus, the potential for people inhaling these droplet nuclei into their noses and mouths means additional prevention steps are needed. The WHO previously maintained that the novel coronavirus is mainly spread by respiratory droplet transmission, but has since acknowledged the emerging evidence for airborne transmission in \"crowded, closed, poorly ventilated settings,\" while cautioning that the evidence is preliminary and should be assessed further.\n",

    "Background and context": "There is concern about transmission by people without symptoms because this makes disease prevention more challenging. For example, while it is a helpful public health measure to recommend that people self-isolate when ill, it is insufficient to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus when someone who never develops symptoms or who has not yet developed symptoms can still infect others.

    "What our experts say": "People who have been infected with COVID-19 but don't have symptoms are considered \"asymptomatic.\" People infected with COVID-19 whose symptoms have not yet developed are called \"pre-symptomatic.\" Even as people who are asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic don't display symptoms, they are still infected with the virus, and have the potential to shed the virus. This means that people without symptoms can still spread the virus to others, even if they don't feel sick.\n\n",

      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "There have been some questions about using digital thermometers as more people use them to check for fever (higher than normal body temperature), one of the symptoms of COVID-19. While checking body temperature can be part of evaluating whether someone may have COVID-19, it is important to note that checking for fever alone is not enough to determine whether someone has COVID-19 in part because there are many causes of fever. In addition, some people with COVID-19 may not have any symptoms of illness or may have symptoms other than fever. Digital thermometers can also be inaccurate or used incorrectly. Checking body temperature with a digital thermometer is not a substitute for COVID-19 testing.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Digital thermometers do not damage your brain in any way. Digital thermometers are universally used with children and adults and can come in a wide variety of forms including oral, rectal, temporal artery (forehead), tympanic (ear), and axillary (armpit) versions. These thermometers require a sensor, which typically produces either a voltage, current, or resistance change when there is a change of temperature. These are all widely used and safe. There is no evidence to suggest that neurons or brain cells can be damaged in the process. \n\nOlder thermometers were glass tubes with mercury inside them. The mercury expanded and contracted based on the temperature of the subject. Now, digital thermometers are far more common and easier to read than traditional mercury-based thermometers, and digital thermometers are considered safer than mercury-based thermometers because mercury is toxic, and there is a possibility for exposure if the glass tube containing the mercury were to break. \n",

    "Question": "What do we know so far about COVID-19 and alkalinity?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "In chemistry, _alkaline_ is an adjective that is sometimes used to describe a subset of bases that dissolve in water. Alkalinity, however, is a different term used by oceanographers and hydrologists to describe the capacity of water to resist pH changes that would make it more acidic, in contrast to basicity which refers to a measurement on the pH scale above 7. When food is described as alkaline, this is often based on misconceptions about the impacts of eating food on the pH of the body. Fluids associated with various organs and tissues in the body have different typical pH levels; for example, the stomach operates at an acidic pH for digestion. Eating food does not have a significant impact on blood pH as this is regulated by the body to stay relatively neutral (pH of 7.35 to 7.45).\n\nOne popular social media post incorrectly applies a research study about another type of coronavirus called mouse hepatitis type 4 (MHV4), and also lists food items with pH values that are inaccurate. For example, lemons are falsely listed to have a pH of 9.9 (the true pH is closer to 2-2.6) and avocados with a pH of 15.6 (the true pH is likely 6.27-6.58). For reference, the pH scale only goes from 0 to 14, and food products are generally within a pH range of about 2 to 8. **It is important to note that eating more alkaline food does not change the risk of COVID-19 infection or treat COVID-19.**\n",
    "What our experts say": "Eating more acidic or alkaline foods is not related to an increased or decreased risk of COVID-19 infection. Widely circulated social media posts falsely suggest that the pH of COVID-19 ranges from 5.5 to 8.5. Often these posts advise readers to eat alkaline foods (specifically fruits and vegetables) with a pH of more than 8.5 to prevent COVID-19.  Viruses themselves do not have pH levels, because they are not water-based solutions. \n\nIn chemistry, pH (power of hydrogen, or potential for hydrogen) is a scale used for water-based solutions to indicate if they are acidic (pH below 7, with a lower pH indicating a stronger acid), neutral (pH around 7), or basic (pH above 7, with a higher indicating a stronger base). Since viruses are not water-based, the pH scale does not apply to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the disease that causes COVID-19.\n\nWhile some illnesses or medications may cause blood pH levels to increase or decrease in our bodies, foods eaten as part of a regular diet do not have a significant impact on blood pH.  Saliva and urine pH may change in response to diet, but these changes are variable from person to person and** will not prevent or cure COVID-19.**\n\nThe posts in question seem to consistently refer to a 1991 paper in which another type of coronavirus, the coronavirus mouse hepatitis type 4 (MHV4), was studied in mouse or rat cells in a solution with a pH of 5.5 to 8.5.  Mice and rats are not the same as humans, and this study was not conducted in humans or on human cells. In addition, MHV4 is not the same as the SARS-Cov-2 virus that causes COVID-19, and this study was performed well before the SARS-Cov-2 was discovered in 2019.\n\nEating a well-balanced diet including a variety of fruits and vegetables can help support immune function which may help to prevent illness in general, but there is not enough evidence to suggest that a well-balanced diet would be effective in preventing or treating COVID-19.  \n",

    "Question": "Why are Brazil's cases surging right now?",
    "Status": "Published",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Despite the COVID-19 risk factor of older age being favorable for Brazil’s relatively younger population, Brazil has seen a surge in the number of cases. Initially, transmission of the virus was limited to the larger cities of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro but now has moved inland into smaller cities. Thirteen million people in Brazil live in favelas, in close proximity to one another with lack of access to clean water. This makes the physical distancing and hygiene conditions necessary to prevent transmission of the virus very difficult. Smaller cities also have weaker health systems and fewer health care professionals to prevent the spread.\n\nThere has also been criticism of data suppression by the Brazilian government, and some opinions suggest that the actual cases could be seven times higher than the official figures.\n\nEasing of preventative measures like opening up of malls and beaches and crowding of people is another reason to see increases in the number of cases. The president of the country has criticized state governments that are making efforts to combat the pandemic. With a president who denies the pandemic as a ‘cold,’ the political turmoil at the center has led to two health minsters being fired or quitting, leaving no public health expert to advise the leadership.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Brazil has reported over 1.2 million cases and 54,000 deaths as of June 26, 2020. The recent surge in cases is mainly stemming from the country's densely populated regions, such as Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro. Studies estimate that 25% of the Brazilian population in Sao Paolo did not adequately adhere to quarantine guidelines, and the presence of densely packed low-income neighborhoods known as favelas has exacerbated the spread of the virus. In a new study, researchers conducted over 3,000 rapid tests in six of the city's most densely populated neighborhoods and found that infection rates were far higher than the official estimates: some studies had previously estimated that 9.5% of people in Sao Paolo were infected, but the most recent estimates from the largest favela in Sao Paola indicated almost 25% of people who were tested were positive. \n\nMedical experts attribute the surge in cases in major cities to relaxed quarantine and isolation measures. Major cities in the country have lifted lockdown measures, and reopened restaurants, shops and businesses. Another research study found that more than 75% of the confirmed cases are from the relatively densely populated southern and southeastern regions of Brazil, and the exponential growth in COVID-19 cases has stemmed from difficulties in effective social distancing. The study reports that many informal workers are continuing to work and information regarding minimum infection prevention and control measures, including hand washing and social distancing, has not been effectively communicated and followed.\n",

    "Question": "What do we know so far about dexamethasone as a potential treatment for COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Treatment",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 and dexamethasone",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Dexamethasone has recently been in the news due to its alleged early success in the RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy) trial, led by a team from Oxford University in the UK. This study is the world's largest and was launched in March to test six potential COVID-19 treatments - five pre-existing medications and convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients - to determine whether or not they can help treat cases of COVID-19. Though this study has received significant media attention since the search for any potential treatments is urgent, no study has been published by the RECOVERY team as of yet and no other countries have approved dexamethasone for severe cases of COVID-19. \n\n\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "Dexamethasone is a low-cost, anti-inflammatory medication that is part of the corticosteroid family. Corticosteroids function similarly to the cortisol produced in the body's adrenal glands yet they are synthetically made. Corticosteroids are commonly prescribed to suppress the immune system and reduce swelling and itching common to allergic reactions. \nDexamethasone has been widely used since the 1960s, but it has recently been part of several studies exploring potential therapies for COVID-19. In the RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy) Trial at Oxford University (UK), the largest COVID-19 drug trial to date, researchers studied the impact of dexamethasone by comparing the roughly 2,000 patients who received the medication with the 4,000 patients who did not receive the medication. They found that the mortality risk was lowered for patients with severe cases of COVID-19 who were on ventilators or receiving oxygen. For patients with mild cases of COVID-19, beneficial effects were not observed. \nDexamethasone has not been approved as an official treatment for COVID-19 outside the United Kingdom thus far, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has urged caution since these results are preliminary, have yet to be evaluated through the peer-review process, and represent findings from only one trial. Despite this, the medication is currently being used in several countries as a part of various treatment strategies for COVID-19. The WHO has also recently added dexamethasone and other steroids into its treatment guidelines for COVID-19.\nIn two other recent studies using corticosteroidal medications (including dexamethasone) as potential treatments for COVID-19, one found a reduction in the number of days patients required ventilator support, and the other found that the corticosteroid medications were associated with an increased duration of illness (among other adverse impacts). Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, are still an unproven treatment for COVID-19.\n",

    "Background and context": "Zoonotic diseases, like the virus SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 and Ebola virus disease, have shown a propensity for not only spilling over from animal reservoirs into humans, but sustained human to human transmission. These factors are influenced by several variables, such as climate change, human development and encroachment on natural environments. As a result, more focus as been placed on One Health, which underscores the relationship between human, animal, and environmental health. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Zoonotic diseases are infectious diseases that can spread from animals to humans. \"Spillover events\" (when a disease jumps from an animal to a human) have been known to cause outbreaks, like ebola virus disease. Since some infectious diseases can live within an animal without causing any illness to it, certain interactions with an infected animal can result in transmission to humans. \nRoughly 6 out of 10 known infectious diseases in people are zoonotic. Of all the emerging infectious diseases (a disease that has newly appeared in a population or has increased incidence in recent years), 3 out of 4 come from animals. Scientists are increasingly worried about zoonotic diseases as they are growing in frequency. In some cases which animal transferred infection to humans is unknown, like SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. As humans expand in the environment through globalization and infringement on undeveloped natural environments, like forests or jungles, the risk for exposure to zoonotic disease increases. Similarly, factors such as the exotic animal trade, the impacts of climate change, and the expansion of animal markets can cause zoonotic diseases to spread more rapidly and widely.\n\n",

    "Question": "Are any of the following foods or drinks, alone or in combination with other, effective in treating or curing COVID-19: turmeric, lemon, pineapple, onion, blackseed oil, honey, garlic, tea, ginger, zinc, or selenium?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background and context": "There are many fruits, vegetables, herbs, and dietary supplements that have been promoted as preventive therapies or cures for COVID-19. While _some _of these nutrition-based therapies have theoretical links to scientific research, based on previously conducted cellular studies, animal studies, or human studies, there is not significant scientific evidence on their impacts against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The [World Health Organization][1] (WHO) and other health authorities have continually denounced these reports because there is no current scientific evidence suggesting that specific foods or dietary supplements prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19. \n\nIt is important to be aware of possible interactions between medications and some dietary supplements, and there are known risks that accompany supplement use for some patients (i.e, pregnant or lactating women, patients with kidney or liver disease). Some supplement products have been found to not have the components that are advertised on the product packaging, and may contain varied doses, or may contain other contaminants (i.e. heavy metals, pesticides) or additives.\n\n**Turmeric:** The primary active compound in Turmeric, curcumin, has been extensively studied for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. In spite of its potential and successes in laboratory-based tests, most clinical trials in humans** **have not shown an effect, and more studies are needed to determine if or when curcumin may benefit people. Curcumin has not been studied in patients with COVID-19, though clinical trials have been proposed. The World Health Organization has a [specific statement][2] on their website suggesting that there is no current scientific evidence that turmeric prevents COVID-19. There is also no scientific evidence that turmeric can successfully treat or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Lemon:** Lemon is a great source of vitamin C and can be part of a healthy diet. The World Health Organization has a [specific statement][2] on their website suggesting that there is no current scientific evidence that lemon prevents COVID-19. There is also no scientific evidence that lemon can successfully treat or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Pineapple:** A variety of fruits (pineapple, mango, durian, and others) all may be included in a well-balanced diet to promote general health and well-being. The World Health Organization has a [specific statement][2] on their website suggesting that there is no current scientific evidence that these and other fruits prevent COVID-19. There is also no scientific evidence that fruits can successfully treat or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Onion:** As a member of the same family as garlic, onions are also known to have some antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory qualities, but studies are limited. To date, there are no studies that evaluate onions as a therapy for COVID-19, and there is no scientific evidence to suggest that onions will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Blackseed Oil**: (also called Nigella sativa) Black seed (or Nigella sativa) is used as a medicinal plant around the world and has been reportedly used to treat a variety of conditions from influenza to diabetes, inflammation to cough or fever. To date, black seed oil and its compounds have not been studied as a possible treatment or cure against COVID-19 in cell studies, animal studies, or human studies, though the idea has been proposed. Currently, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that black see oil will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Honey:** Honey may have some wound healing and antibacterial properties, but much of the published research focuses on topical (skin) application, which doesn't apply to COVID-19 because the virus is an internal infection. While it can be part of a healthy diet, honey is a source of sugar, and leading health organizations recommend limiting dietary sugar intake. Health experts have suggested that products like ginger, tea, or honey may make us feel better when we are sick, but that does not mean that these items cure or treat disease. There is also no scientific evidence that honey can successfully treat or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Garlic:** Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial and anti-tumor properties, though study results are often mixed and there are limitations, gaps, and shortcomings in the published evidence. While it has been widely studied in preparations as a supplement, extract, and food, there is currently no evidence that garlic will prevent or treat COVID-19. The World Health Organization has a [specific statement][3] on their website suggesting that “there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.” There is also no scientific evidence that garlic can successfully treat or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Tea:** Some teas may have health benefits, but evidence is limited because of difficulty studying the possible effect of tea alone. Health experts have suggested that products like ginger, tea, or honey may make us feel better when we are sick, but that does not mean that these items cure or treat disease. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that tea will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Ginger:** As a supplement, ginger is most commonly prescribed to help with nausea. Health experts have suggested that products like ginger, tea, or honey may make us feel better when we are sick, but that does not mean that these items cure or treat disease. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that ginger will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Zinc:** Zinc is a mineral that is used throughout the body and is needed for a healthy immune system. While zinc is available in many foods, use of zinc supplements has been shown to be helpful for wound healing and may shorten the duration of colds and acute diarrhea. Use of zinc should be guided by healthcare providers, since there are known side effects that may result from incorrect dosing. In addition, long-term zinc use is known to cause copper deficiency and is not recommended. There are clinical trials registered to study zinc (often in combinations with other vitamins, minerals, or medications) as a therapy for patients with COVID-19, but results are not available yet. While there are many scientists and health professionals that believe zinc may be a helpful therapy for COVID-19 based on its known benefits with other conditions, there is not enough scientific evidence to suggest that zinc supplementation will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Selenium:** Selenium is a mineral has many functions in the body; like other minerals, it is needed for a healthy immune system. Selenium is available in many foods and is also available in supplement form. Most selenium studies to date have focused on thyroid disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Recently, there are scientific papers that have been published as “Letters to the Editor” and similar that suggest that selenium may be beneficial, but these papers are largely observational, have many limitations, and have not gone through the rigorous peer-review process to validate the research methods and claims made. Without further validation, they should be interpreted very cautiously. At present, there is not enough scientific evidence to suggest that selenium supplementation will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19.\n\n  [1]: https://www.who.int/campaigns/connecting-the-world-to-combat-coronavirus/healthyathome/healthyathome---healthy-diet\n  [2]: https://www.who.int/southeastasia/outbreaks-and-emergencies/novel-coronavirus-2019/fact-or-fiction\n  [3]: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters\n",
    "What our experts say": "While a varied and balanced diet including fruits and vegetables does help to support the immune system in general, there is no evidence to suggest that special diets, consumption of particular foods, or taking vitamin, mineral, or herbal supplements will prevent, treat or cure COVID-19. \n\nFor information about the attributed of specific foods or drinks, please see the '**Background & Context**' section for this question.\n",

    "Question": "Is ivermectin a proven treatment for COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "On: COVID-19 & ivermectin",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Partner Organization"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "Nigeria"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Headlines from May 2020 widely touted ivermectin as a breakthrough drug with “astounding” results in patients with COVID-19. While the study has not yet been peer reviewed or published, preprint and press release information reports lower mortality in patients on ivermectin therapy in four Florida (US) hospitals. Many news reports also link back to a paper that reported results from testing the medication in cell culture—not in humans. At present, clinical studies are ongoing, and the drug requires additional research to determine possible benefits and risks for patients with COVID-19.\n\nThough ivermectin is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for other illnesses and it has been shown to decrease the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in cell studies, it should not be prescribed for COVID-19 or taken without medical supervision. The US FDA has specifically issued multiple statements to further advise the public. First, they suggest that “while there are approved uses for ivermectin in people and animals, it is not approved for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. You should not take any medicine to treat or prevent COVID-19 unless it has been prescribed to you by your health care provider and acquired from a legitimate source.” In a later statement, the US FDA also suggested that people should not use Ivermectin intended for animals as a treatment for COVID-19.  \n",
    "What our experts say": "As of now, there is not enough evidence to support the use of Ivermectin to treat COVID-19. \n\nIvermectin has been used to treat infectious diseases in humans and animals for over thirty years, primarily for treating parasitic roundworm infections in the intestinal tract, skin, and eyes. The medication has not been approved as a treatment for COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). A regional office of the WHO, called the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), has advised against the use of ivermectin for any purposes other than those for which its use is authorized. \n\nAs of now, PAHO and WHO recommend that the use of ivermectin for new uses like COVID-19 only be used in research studies so scientists can determine if using ivermectin is safe and effective. There are currently more than 30 studies on ivermectin underway.\n",

    "Question": "What is pool testing and why is it being used?",

    "Source of the question": [

    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [

    ],
    "Background and context": "There have been many headlines in the news about \"pool testing\" for COVID-19.  Pool testing for COVID-19 has already been implemented or is currently being considered in several places, particularly where there are large populations as well as limited time and supplies for testing. For example, Chinese health officials have used this method in Wuhan and Beijing to quickly test large numbers of people. U.S. federal health officials have also been discussing the potential for pool testing, informed by how this has been implemented in the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory when it was running low on testing reagents in March 2020 and has since reported 50-60% savings in reagents along with 20-30% savings in labor. Most health officials believe that the savings from pool testing will be limited outside of areas where the virus is rarely present. While pool testing alone is not expected to resolve the current bottlenecks in testing, this form of testing can be a helpful tool in some situations.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Pool testing, distinct from individual testing, tests a pool (or group) of people at the same time and is a form of testing that has been used for diseases like HIV/AIDS before the current COVID-19 pandemic. Normally, when a COVID-19 test is done using a nasal swab on a patient, that sample is then tested individually to determine if the virus is present, and this can take anywhere from 15 minutes to several days, depending on the abilities of the lab running the test. With pool testing, anywhere from roughly 3 - 50 samples are combined and all of the swabs are tested at once. If the test result from that pool test is negative, then all patients in that pool do not have the virus. If the result is positive, then each swab must then be tested one-by-one.\n\nPool testing, also called \"batch testing,\" is currently being used in order to test many more people for COVID-19 than individual tests alone. This is because instead of testing patients and then analyzing their samples individually to determine whether or not one patient has been infected with COVID-19, pool testing combines many samples and tests them at the same time. \n\nPool testing has gained popularity in recent months due to surging numbers of COVID-19 infections around the world. This method gives laboratories the ability to save time, test greater numbers of people, and use their resources most efficiently. These tests are most useful in places with large populations but a lower number of COVID-19 cases within that population, including group settings like schools or workplaces. In places with with a high rate of infections, this testing strategy would not be as beneficial since most patients would be tested individually either way. Another potential hurdle is that pool testing might lead to more false-negative tests. This is because if a patient does have the virus and it is present in their individual test sample, that sample will be diluted when it is combined with the rest of the samples from the larger group, possibly to the point where the viral load is undetectable. \n",

    "Question": "How can we tell if an increase in cases is the result of an increase in testing or something else?",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "It is important to evaluate the number of cases, availability of testing, and percent positive rate when evaluating if a true climb in cases is due to a growing hotspot or just an increase in testing availability. Often, lack of testing availability can cloud this issue, which is why evaluating this piece of information in comparison to the growth in case counts while considering percent positive, provides a more accurate picture. \n",
    "What our experts say": "A lot can be learned and based off of the percent-positive rate (e.g. how many tests result positive out of all the tests taken) and the number of cases in total. We cannot assume that an increase in cases or a growing percent-positive rate is purely a result of an increase in testing instead of a growing outbreak. Instead, we need to look at all of them together. \n\nA rise in the number of reported cases of COVID-19 could be related to an expansion of testing if the percentage of positive tests decreases or stays the same at the same time that the number of cases increases. Should percentage of positive tests increase while case counts also go up, this indicates that we cannot entirely blame the increase on expanded testing. The biggest indicator of a growing outbreak is if the percentage of positive tests increases along with the number of cases despite testing data staying the same or decreasing. \n\nWhen testing is not always widely available and reserved just for symptomatic people, the percent positivity will increase as with the number of cases. If testing is expanded and made more available, we will gain a better understanding of the true number of cases and percent-positive rate. If this percent positivity continues to grow along with the number of cases, this would be an indicator that the outbreak is worsening. \n",

    "Question": "What does it mean to have a fever?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Fever has emerged as a common symptom of COVID-19 infection. A World Health Organization report from February of 2020 suggested that fever was reported in 87.9% of patients with confirmed COVID-19. Fever is an increase in body temperature that is a common symptom of illness or infection, but there are other possible reasons for fever that include heat exhaustion, some medications or immunizations, certain types of cancers, and some inflammatory conditions (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis).  \n\nWhile the average normal temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), there is some individual variation where an individual’s normal temperature may be slightly higher or lower even when he or she is healthy. In addition, normal body temperature can vary during the day and is often lower in the morning and higher later in the day. A normal temperature range is generally about 97°F (36.1°C) to 99°F (37.2°C).  \n",
    "What our experts say": "Having a fever means that your body temperature has temporarily increased and it is a signal that your body may be fighting off an infection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control define a fever as a measured temperature of at least 100.4°F (38°C), slightly higher than the average human temperature of 98.6°F (37°C). Fevers are one of the immune system's first reactions to a pathogen - such as a virus or bacteria entering the body. Fevers can also be caused by environmental factors like heat stroke or biological responses like alcohol withdrawal. Your body senses these potential threats and forces itself to raise its temperature (by creating a fever, through chemicals in your blood called 'pyrogens') to make it difficult for the pathogen to use your body as a host and reproduce viruses or bacteria. \n\nNormal body temperatures change every day and usually vary between 97.6°F (36.4°C) and 99.6 °F (37.5°C) with lower body temperatures generally occurring in the morning and higher temperatures occurring at night. For most adults, short-term fevers shouldn't be alarming unless it reaches 103°F (39.4°C) or higher. For infants younger than 3 months, a rectal temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher signals a fever and in that case a doctor should be contacted. For infants between 3 - 24 months, a rectal temperature of 102°F (38.9°C) signals a fever that should also be discussed with a doctor. For other young children, even slight fevers can signal infections, so a doctor should be consulted if a fever appears.\n\n",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Viruses reproduce themselves in bodies by injecting their DNA or RNA into cells in the body. The genetic material from that injection becomes a blueprint for how to make more and more of the virus.\nEventually the cells in our bodies recognize the virus, and develop new ways to prevent it from duplicating. So viruses adapt by mutating, which disguises them once again from our immune systems so they can continue to duplicate.\n Mutation for viruses simply means a change or transformation. RNA viruses, like SARS-CoV-2 which causes COVID-19, mutate a lot. It is important to track these mutations to understand the various identities of the virus and map its trends across the world. However, as these changes happen, it's also important to understand what adaptation the virus is taking and what are their consequences on human health. It's important to keep in mind that mutations might not translate to drastic changes in severity of the illness or increase its mortality. Mutations are a natural process for RNA viruses and should not be seen as an indicator for suddenly a newer, deadlier virus. Understanding these viral changes and genomic epidemiology can help us understand outbreaks better. \n",
    "What our experts say": "There is no evidence to support the idea that the virus has lost its potency. This question likely stems from comments made by an Italian doctor claiming that COVID-19 is losing its potency by mutating into a less harmful version of itself. However, this has been refuted by the World Health Organization and other respected health and medical bodies. \n\nViral mutations are a common aspect of a virus' lifespan and do not necessarily mean that they will become more deadly, contagious, or inherently different.  Mutations that might change how the virus is transmitted, or how it infects people, does not mean that the mutated virus will spread more or be more harmful. Nor does it mean it will spread less or be less harmful. So far, researchers have stated that while the virus is mutating (like all viruses do) these changes do not translate to significant adjustments in transmission or harm to patients.\n",

    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "With an upward trend in adopting pets from shelters during the pandemic, some people are concerned about the risk of animals spreading COVID-19. Additionally, there have been news reports of animals living in households and zoos testing positive for COVID-19, including tigers, lions, and domesticated cats and dogs. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that while the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 is considered low, current recommendations include isolating pets from any sick people in the household as well as limiting interactions between pets and people outside of the household. Both animals and humans can test positive for COVID-19 without showing symptoms.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Yes, but mostly to other animals of the same species. Currently, there is no evidence that animals are a major cause of spreading COVID-19 and the risk of animals passing COVID-19 to humans is low. \n\nAccording to a recently published study in the New England Journal of Medicine, transmission of the virus has been reported between cats, none of which had symptoms. The study found that three domestic cats infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 were able to transmit the virus to three other cats with no previous infection. None of the cats in the experiment showed any symptoms during the course of infection, but researchers found the continued spreading the virus from their noses for about six days. However, the research is rapidly evolving. This is just the first study to document asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 in cats and as of now, there is no evidence of transmission of COVID-19 from cats to humans. \n\nCats aren't the only animals that have been shown to spread the virus with no symptoms. Based on recent research conducted by the Dutch government, it is believed that minks infected with COVID-19 spread the virus to two human employees at regional farms. The minks were having symptoms of a respiratory illness, while another study about COVID-19 in animals has shown that mink can be infected with the virus without having any symptoms.\nDogs, tigers, lions, and ferrets have also tested positive for COVID-19, but these animals all showed symptoms after testing positive for the virus and likely acquired the virus from humans. \n\n\n",

      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [

    ],
    "Background and context": "There is growing interest in understanding the process of testing vaccines, to get a sense of how long it may take before there is a widely-available vaccine to address the COVID-19 pandemic. There have been many press releases and articles about vaccines in development and the start of human trials, yet health experts at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) warn that it will take time to screen out ineffective and unsafe vaccines as well as to prepare for vaccine use at scale. People are eager for a vaccine to be ready soon for many reasons, including protection of human life, economic recovery, reducing educational interruptions, and lifting restrictions on activities that people enjoy.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Substantial research needs to be completed by scientists before any potential vaccine undergoes phased testing. Once it gets to that stage, there are three research phases of trials that take place before the vaccine can be deployed for use. During the first stage (Phase I), the new vaccine is provided to small groups of people—the first time the vaccine is tested in humans. The second stage (Phase II) involves testing the vaccine on people who have similar characteristics (such as age and physical health) to the target population, or the group for which the vaccine is intended. The goal of this stage is to identify the most effective dosages and schedule for Phase III trials. The final stage (Phase III) provides the vaccine to thousands of people from the target population to see how safe and effective it is. Once the vaccine clears this last stage, the manufacturer can apply for a license from regulatory authorities (like the FDA) to market for human use.\n\nSometimes medications that have already been approved by the U.S. Food and Drugs Administration in clinical trials will enter into a Phase IV trial. This phase focuses on potential side effects from the vaccine or medication that were not seen in the first three phases. This phase also helps researchers understand how well a vaccine works over a longer time frame and how safe it is, often with thousands of people over several years. Phase IV is also called a 'post-marketing surveillance' trial.\n\n\n",

    "Question": "Is it true that India's Bharat Biotech is not too far away from finding a vaccine for COVID-19 as they have now been approved for human trials?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [

    ],

    "Background and context": "Bharat Biotech International Limited is a Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company that focuses primarily on manufacturing vaccines and bio-therapeutics. It has produced over 160 patents since starting operations in 1996. On June 29, 2020, Bharat Biotech announced that it received regulatory approval for Phase 1 and Phase 2 human clinical trials for COVAXIN, India’s first homegrown vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) after submitting data from preclinical studies. The vaccine was developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology (NIV). ICMR has announced an ambitious deadline of August 15th 2020 to launch the vaccine, which has been criticized by doctors and researchers as a rushed and impractical timeline that carries substantial risks. ICMR has clarified that the intention is to complete the trials as fast as possible and speed up recruitment of participants, but everything will depend on the results of the clinical trials.\n",
    "What our experts say": "At this time it is unlikely that a vaccine for COVID-19 will be produced in the near future. The Indian Council of Medical Research, the primary body overseeing clinical research for COVID-19 in India, has pushed to fast-track clinical trials for the Bharat Biotech-developed drug COVAXIN. ICMR has announced an ambitious deadline of August 15th 2020 to launch the vaccine, which has been criticized by doctors and researchers as a rushed and impractical timeline that carries substantial risks. ICMR has clarified that the intention is to complete the trials as fast as possible and speed up recruitment of participants, but everything will depend on the results of the clinical trials. \n\nThe timeline to develop a safe and effective vaccine is lengthy and requires several stages of clinical trials, as well as plenty of regulatory oversight. This process usually takes several months and can continue for more than a year. Bharat Biotech, the pharmaceutical maker of COVAXIN, has obtained regulatory approval for Phase 1 and 2 human clinical trials for its vaccine. However, by August 15, 2020 it is not likely that the vaccine will pass the next round of human clinical trials and be ready for use,  as the ICMR has indicated. \n\nIn a directive to researchers at 12 healthcare institutions, Dr. Balram Bhargava, the Director-General of ICMR, claimed that the world’s first COVID-19 vaccine should complete clinical trials soon in order to be ready for use by August 15th, India’s Independence Day. However, the data from the pre-clinical studies on the vaccine has not yet been published. Even if pre-clinical data is promising, human clinical trials that are necessary to deploy a vaccine take place in stages that take a very long time, in order to assess efficacy and safety. The process typically takes well over 12 months to complete.\n\nLots of testing happens in animals before a vaccine begins phased testing in humans. During the first stage of vaccine testing on humans (Phase I), a new vaccine is provided to small groups of people—which is the first time the vaccine is tested in humans. The second stage (Phase II) involves testing the vaccine on people who have similar characteristics (such as age and physical health) to the target population, which means the group for which the vaccine is intended. The goal of this stage is to identify the most effective dosages and schedule for Phase III trials. The final stage (Phase III) provides the vaccine to hundreds of people across several different healthcare settings from the target population to see how safe and effective it is. Once the vaccine clears this last stage, the manufacturer can apply for a license from regulatory authorities to market for human use.\n",

    "Source of the question": [

      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Many businesses and organizations are following World Health Organization (WHO) and U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommendations for measuring the temperature of every employee at a business location, though this is not a requirement or recommendation in every state in the United States or every country in the world. As temperature checks are not a stipulation to re-open a business in most countries, many business owners have opted not to perform this task.\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "Checking people for fever before they interact with others has been proposed as a means to help reduce transmission of disease. Some countries such as China and South Korea have widespread checks of body temperature to help identify individuals with fevers in offices, restaurants, airports, or other popularly-frequented locations. As a standalone measure, checking for fever is insufficient to prevent disease transmission because of how asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic people can get others sick. Diagnostic testing for COVID-19 - not temperature checks - is a much more accurate, effective means of determining whether or not employees might be infected with the virus. Additionally, temperature testing may be difficult to implement in some locations due to limited resources, privacy concerns, and other reasons. \n\nSome experts have cited concerns about workplace surveillance and privacy while using infrared temperature checks. There are also questions about the effectiveness and accuracy of these workplace thermometers, especially considering how many pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic patients might not have any symptoms during the duration of their illness. Lastly, fevers might be indicative of other factors or illnesses unrelated to COVID-19; for example, elevated body temperature is commonly observed in people who are physically exerting energy or under great stress.\n",

    "Question": "Can you explain how the COVID-19 test using tears works?",
    "Status": "Published",

    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & Testing",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "There is a growing number of research studies as well as media reports about COVID-19 tests that use samples of tears, instead of nasal swabs, throat swabs, saliva collection, blood draws, or other bodily samples. Tears originate near the nasal cavity, and someone with COVID-19 can shed viral particles in their tears. \nLike nasal swab tests, COVID-19 tests using tears analyze the sample through polymerise chain reaction (PCR) and are currently proposed as a potential option for diagnostic testing (checking whether someone has an active infection), which is different from antibody testing (checking whether someone had a past infection and now has antibodies against COVID-19). It is important to note that COVID-19 tests using tears are still in the research and development phase.\nThe interest in COVID-19 tests using tears may be related to general interest in increasing the availability, accuracy, affordability, safety, speed, and ease of COVID-19 testing. For example, there is some interest in nasal swab test alternatives to reduce physical discomfort and to avoid inducing sneezing or coughing reflexes that could transmit virus particles to health care workers.\n",
    "What our experts say": "As of now, there is no consensus about whether or not tears can accurately detect the virus in an infected person, but early study results have shown a lower amount of the virus in tears than in other bodily fluids. Some researchers believe parts of the virus might be able to spread from a person's nasal cavity into their eyes, and eventually into tears in the inner corner of the eyes. Whether or not this type of testing will work is still uncertain as scientists have been testing many bodily fluids like semen, saliva, urine, and tears to determine whether or not the virus can be detected in them and if it can, how much. \n\nHumans produce tears in the back of their eye sockets, which is close to the nasal cavity where most COVID-19 tests are being done now. The nasal cavity is located at the back of the nose and is where the COVID-19 virus starts reproducing in people exposed to the virus.\n\nNasal swab tests are designed to collect samples from the nasal cavity that have some genetic material of the virus (DNA and RNA). Tear tests for COVID-19 would try to focus on this similar area of the head as there is a small, thin layer of tissue called the 'conjuctiva' that acts as a bridge between the nasal cavity and the eye socket. \n",

    "Question": "Can drinking alcohol prevent or cure COVID-19?\n",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "Nigeria"
    ],
    "Background and context": "There are rumors circulating that drinking alcohol can prevent or treat COVID-19. This might be related to how alcohol (with concentration levels above 60-70%) is being used as a disinfectant for hands and surfaces, but it is important to note that drinking alcohol does not destroy the novel coronavirus within your body.\n\nWhile alcoholic beverages typically contain ethyl alcohol (also known as ethanol), media reports suggest that some alcoholic beverages have been illegally adulterated with toxic substances that smell similar, causing additional deaths during the pandemic in some countries. There are also other alcoholic products, such as hand sanitizers, that are not meant for human consumption. Drinking other forms of alcohol, such as methyl alcohol (also known as methanol) in chemical disinfectants, can cause blindness, kidney disease, or death even in small quantities.\n",
    "What our experts say": "No, drinking alcohol does not prevent or cure COVID-19. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are recommended to disinfect hands and surfaces, but drinking or ingesting alcohol is in no way recommended. In fact, alcohol consumption could worsen COVID-19 symptoms and could weaken your body's ability to fight the virus, if you have lowered immunity. Excessive consumption of alcohol is a risk factor for many diseases, and alcohol should only be consumed in moderation, if at all.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) warns that drinking alcohol will not protect against infection or illness from COVID-19. In fact, alcohol consumption can reduce the immune system's ability to fight infection and increase the chance of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), one of the most severe symptoms of COVID-19. Additionally, alcohol consumption has other negative health consequences (ex. motor and cognitive impairments, mental health impacts, violence, pregnancy impacts, carcinogenic exposure, associations with several other diseases). In response to rising rates of alcohol consumption and alcohol being one of the most widely abused substances in the world, the WHO has advised that \"people should minimize their alcohol consumption at any time, and particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n",

      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Research shows that the pressure from flushing a toilet creates tiny droplets in the air that can rise as high as three feet above the toilet. This simulation was modeled for toilets in general without the SARS-CoV-2 virus, however, and it cannot be confirmed if the virus can spread through such plumes. Research conducted in two hospitals in China showed that aerosols were found in higher concentrations in a toilet of a hospital in Wuhan. However, the infectivity (strength of the virus to attack a person) is not known. It is also unknown if the aerosols collected were deposited from the breathing, coughing, or via the toilet flush. Since there is a possible risk, albeit low, public health experts recommend wearing masks inside public restrooms, closing the lid before flushing, keeping the toilets well ventilated and exhausts working at all times, and washing your hands with soap and warm water for 20+ seconds.\n",
    "What our experts say": "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, feces of some patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 have been shown to carry the virus. This has caused many to question the safest way to use the toilet so as to prevent any COVID-19 infection from potentially spreading when the toilet is flushed. The reason many people are concerned about this topic is that it has been discovered that the virus leaves the human body through our waste, which is why it has been found in the feces of infected individuals. When we flush waste down the toilet, traces of the virus may linger in the air long enough to be inhaled. Studies have shown that during a toilet flush, particles can be transported more than 3 feet (1m) upward and can float in the air for more than a minute. It is unknown if the particles that linger in the air are infectious, and how many virus particles are needed to cause an infection. Since there are many unknowns, by precaution, public health experts recommend closing the lid before flushing and wearing masks inside public restrooms.\n",

    "Background and context": "There have also been cases of children with COVID-19 presenting with a multi system inflammation, especially around the heart, lung, and brain. There has been some evidence that adult patients with COVID-19 can develop heart-related conditions or complications related to pre-existing cardiac issues, leading to concerns for heart damage as a result of the infection. \n",
    "What our experts say": "COVID-19 infections can have an impact on blood and circulation through an increased risk of blood clotting. Blood clots are a clump of blood that has formed into a semi-solid or even gel-like state. Recent studies have found a concerning trend in blood clotting of COVID-19 patients. Studies from the Netherlands and France found that 20-30% of critically ill COVID-19 patients had blood clots, which can be dangerous. Many of these circulatory issues and the frequency of clots can lead to rashes, swelling of the legs, challenges in vascular access for medications, and even death. Severe clotting and circulatory issues, like COVID-19 associated blood clots, tend to occur more in severely ill patients rather than those with mild symptoms. \n",

    "Question": "How effective are Remdesivir and Favipiravir and can they be taken without medical supervision? ",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "With efforts to find therapeutic options for the millions of patients suffering with COVID-19, there has been a rapid pace at drug evaluation. While some treatments are being evaluated and generic versions might be approved, there is still not enough data to confirm specific treatments for COVID-19 patients. Studies have found successful outcomes with Remdesivir, which has been approved in several countries. While these emergent use applications are an encouraging sign, it is important to monitor patients closely and report their outcomes or negative side effects. \n",
    "What our experts say": "SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 is a new infectious disease and, while there has been a lot of research aimed at identifying possible treatments, many therapies remain under investigation for both safety and effectiveness. \n \nIn a recent study funded by Gilead Sciences, a biopharmaceutical company, 53 patients with severe cases of COVID-19 were prescribed Remdesivir, and researchers observed clinical improvements, including a decreased need for breathing support, in 68% (36 of 53 patients) of the participants. While the initial data looks promising for this drug, it is important to note that this initial study was small and the drug has not been rigorously studied for COVID-19. In addition, the study did not include patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 symptoms. \n \nFavipiravir is also considered to be a possible treatment for COVID-19. A small study showed the virus being reduced faster with the drug in comparison to other medications. Without further study, there is not enough evidence suggesting effectiveness and safety.\n\nIn general, studies remain underway, and it is too early to determine which medications may be effective therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients. At present, Remdesivir has been given emergency use authorization in the U.S. and approval in Japan for severe COVID-19 cases. When either Remdesivir or Favipiravir is prescribed, it is important that medical providers monitor the patient's clinical condition noting effectiveness and possible negative side effects. Taking either drug without medical supervision is not recommended and may be harmful. \n",

    "Question": "Why are we repurposing old drugs to fight new diseases, and what might be the implications for COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Drug repurposing is a safe and successful pathway to speed up drug discovery and development compared with starting from scratch. Drug repurposing uses drugs that have either received regulatory approval, have failed in clinical trials or are in later stages of clinical trials, in order to leverage their detailed information on safety, toxicity, formulation, manufacturing plans, etc. Beyond the pandemic context, it is playing a vital role in several therapeutic areas, including, the discovery of new antibiotics and the development of drugs to combat Alzheimer’s disease. For example, Rifabutin is an antibiotic that has been around for decades and is used to treat tuberculosis, especially in people with HIV/AIDS. Recently, the drug was found to be effective against a superbug ‘Acinetobacter baumannii’ which emerged during the Iraq War in military treatment facilities. This antibiotic had been overlooked until now for this disease but new technology has allowed scientists to discover new strengths of this long existing antibiotic. Another recent example of successful drug repurposing comes from a Phase II clinical trial result that has shown that a leukemia drug – nilotinib, usually used to treat cancer of the blood cells – has been found to be safe and well tolerated and effective in reducing the effects of Alzheimer’s disease.\n",
    "What our experts say": "There is a whole branch of medical research and pharmaceutical companies dedicated to drug repurposing. In practice, it has led to some therapeutic breakthroughs. For example, aspirin which is historically known for treatment of pain, fever or inflammation, has then be found to be effective against some cardiovascular diseases and is now being studied for potential anti-tumor growth in some cancers.\n\nDeveloping new treatments against new diseases often takes several years, if not decades. With the COVID-19 pandemic death toll increasing by the day, scientists are racing to find drugs that could prevent, treat or simply decrease the severity of COVID-19. Scientists have therefore turned their attention to studying drugs that have been studied for other viruses like the MERS coronavirus, HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), hepatitis C, ebola, influenza, etc. to see whether these drugs would also be effective against this new threat, COVID-19. Since these studies build on existing knowledge, the drug development timeline is substantially shortened, as is the required financial investment. Beyond the time-intensive process of developing new drugs, the advantages of repurposing drugs are numerous. First, existing drugs already have an existing safety track record, and have obtained regulatory approval or are in the later stages of clinical trials. Moreover, they have already been produced and may already be on the market, so plans to increase manufacturing can rapidly occur since the infrastructure already exists and does not need to be re-created. Because of this, scientists can focus on studying whether these drugs are effective against COVID-19, and if so, they can be brought to clinical use at the bedside of patients rapidly. Drug repurposing is very common in medical research as science rarely happens in a vacuum, but rather builds on previous iterations and experience. \n",

    "Question": "What are dual treatments and are there any available for COVID-19 right now?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Given the current absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, researchers are urgently looking for treatments for the disease. To this end, there is a wide range of both existing drugs (i.e. approved and regulated for different health conditions) and potential new ones being tested globally. These tests are being conducted in laboratories and animal and clinical studies, and once proven effective they are moved onto clinical trials. In addition to studies on singular drugs, researchers are testing what are known as combination therapies, in which two or more drugs are taken to treat a single disease. The rationale for combination therapy is that different drugs work through different mechanisms, and grouping more than one together can increase the treatment's efficacy,  reduce treatment duration, and reduce the likelihood of drug resistance.\n",
    "What our experts say": "\"Combination treatments\" are the use of two or more drugs to treat a single disease. Currently, there are no combination treatments (also known as dual treatments) that are officially approved for use to treat COVID-19. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, announced on June 23, 2020 while testifying before a House committee on the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic that Remdesivir is being used in combination with anti-inflammatory drug baricitinib. An NIH clinical trial has been underway since May to test the efficacy of the combined treatment, with results not yet released.\n\nOnly three standalone drugs have officially received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) in the US; these include the anti-viral remdesivir, anti-malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (which the FDA later issued a warning for), and a drug used to sedate patients that are on a ventilator. (These EUAs do not constitute a formal approval of the drug, but rather a possibility given to American doctors to use chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 if the doctor has no other options and after discussing with the patients the risks involved.)\n\nThough no combination treatments have yet to be formally approved for use, they are being widely tested. One example of a combination therapy being tested is the dual use of drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, which are in use to treat (not cure) HIV. The combination of these two drugs is known under the brand name Kaletra. Studies are still relatively inconclusive, but most have shown Kaletra to be ineffective for improving COVID-19 outcomes. One study, however, found that when taken with two other drugs — ribavirin and interferon beta-1b — the virus took less time to clear from the patient's body. There are a number of limitations from this trial that warrant further testing. \n\nOther studies testing combination therapy are focusing on pairs with remdesivir, given that it's the treatment with the most promising evidence thus far. One study is testing whether remdesivir increases in effectiveness if taken with an anti-inflammatory drug known as baricitinib. Another is testing the combination of remdesivir with the drug leronlimab, an antiviral that has also has shown to have some anti-inflammatory benefits. \nThese studies will get us closer to understanding if certain combination therapies might be effective for treating COVID-19.\n",

    "Question": "Does COVID-19 impact men worse than women?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on men have been shown in a number of studies and hospital data. To clarify, the number of cases has appeared relatively equal, but vulnerability to the virus and mortality have not. A recent study from The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that of 5700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the New York City area, 39.7% of patients were female while 60.3% were male, demonstrating significantly disparate hospitalization rates based on sex. Sex and gender-based discrepancies are commonly documented in scientific literature, and are helpful for understanding how and why a health condition or disease manifests. For instance, women are twice as likely as men to become depressed, and men are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The gender dimensions of diseases are both physical as well as socially constructed. For example, higher estrogen levels in a women born biologically female is a determinant of health (biological), as is a higher likelihood to carry out domestic work (social). These dimensions also align with the terms sex and gender -- both of which are important to pay attention to in health. Sex describes primarily biological differences between men and women in origin, and gender describes differences primarily caused by social conditions, and can be thought as how one's chosen gender role and how they present. Public health efforts and policies have not always addressed the impacts of diseases across sex and gender, but doing so can help us to understand both the biological and social dimensions of diseases like COVID-19, including who is most at risk and how to mitigate adverse outcomes. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Data from around the world has demonstrated the fact that men are impacted more greatly than women by COVID-19. For example, men are more likely to be hospitalized with severe symptoms of the virus and have higher mortality rates than women; and this finding is consistent across age groups and geographies. Researchers have been trying to understand the causes of this and are developing hypotheses to explain the differences between the immune systems' response to COVID-19 in men and women. At this stage, they are exploring these disparities using biological, social, and behavioral lenses. \nBased on previous studies with similar viruses, data has illustrated that sex differences in immunity are caused by both genetic as well as hormonal differences between women and men. For example, in females, hormones such as estrogen and progesterone may be protective against the virus, yet it is possible testosterone does the opposite for men. In terms of underlying illnesses, the data also illustrates that men are more likely to suffer from hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes than women. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have learned that these types of underlying conditions have been associated with a higher risk of complications from COVID-19. Behavioral factors may also explain this difference. For instance, females may be more likely to be frontline workers than men, which could create more risks for exposure. In terms of lifestyle, men tend to be more likely to be smokers, which is a risk factor for COVID-19 since it is a respiratory illness. \nFrom past studies, we also know that men are less likely to seek out medical care when there's a problem in comparison to women, which means they may interact with the health system at a later stage in the disease when symptoms are more severe. Similarly, in the case of COVID-19, men are less likely to engage in behaviors like mask-wearing and hand-washing, which may increase their risk of contracting the disease. \nSource: Dr. Sabra Klein (Johns Hopkins University)\n",

    "Question": "How does COVID-19 differ from malaria?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "Nigeria"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Malaria is a disease caused by Plasmodium parasites carried by female Anopheles mosquitoes. It's a disease that occurs in over 100 countries. Nearly half of the global population is at risk of malaria, disproportionately people in low- and middle-income countries. According to the latest World Health Organization's World Malaria Report, there were 228 million cases and over 400,000 deaths in a year, with most of the fatalities occurring in Africa. \n\nWith global attention currently focused on COVID-19, public health advocates are calling attention to other diseases that also need to be addressed during this time. For example, the Global Fund reports that a majority of malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS programs may face disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent publication in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases raises specific concerns about screening challenges for countries with malaria, due to similarities of symptoms such as fever with COVID-19. \n\nMalaria has also been linked to COVID-19 because of news coverage on hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria with its overuse contributing to the spread of chloroquine resistance across the world. \n",
    "What our experts say": "COVID-19 and malaria are two different diseases with different ways of being spread and caught. Malaria is spread by mosquitoes, and humans become infected by mosquito bites. COVID-19 is spread by respiratory droplets that we inhale through our nose or our mouth. \n\nCOVID-19 and malaria have been incorrectly linked for several reasons. Firstly, around the world, hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria, received extensive news coverage because there were claims that the drug was effective against COVID-19. A few clinical trials and studies investigated hydroxychloroquine and found no evidence that the drug was effective against COVID-19. In some unfortunate cases, adverse events occurred in people taking this medication. \n\nSecondly, malaria and COVID-19 share some symptoms, although the list of COVID-19 symptoms currently grows and changes every day. Malaria symptoms usually appear 10-15 days after the infective mosquito bite and the first symptoms a patient feels are fever, headache, and chills. On the other hand, people infected with COVID-19 usually develop symptoms within 5 days and, in some cases, infected people never develop symptoms at all. \n\nFinally, there is a difference between fevers caused by malaria and those caused by COVID-19. Often malarial fevers are cyclical, reoccurring at predictable times based on which strain of malaria was contracted. In comparison, fevers caused by COVID-19 do not appear to occur in cycles. The most common COVID-19 symptoms are: fever, dry cough and tiredness. Less common symptoms include: aches and pains, sore throat, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, headache, loss of taste or smell, a rash on skin, or discoloration of fingers or toes. \n\n\n",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"

    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Avifavir as a potential COVID-19 treatment has been emerging in visibility given that delivery of the drug to Russian hospitals began in June, following the approval of the Russian Ministry of Health. The approval follows promising but limited studies on Avifavir's accuracy in Russia, carried out in partnership of The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, and the ChemRar Group. Studies on the drug had also been conducted in China — with seemingly promising results yet severe study limitations — as well as in the US, Italy, Japan and India. Avifavir works by selectively inhibiting RNA polymerase, necessary for viral replication, but data on its efficacy for COVID-19 is still inconclusive. 60,000 doses of the drug are set to be administered by the end of the month, according to RDIF. Trends in Russia's COVID-19 data, and in particular, additional evidence, are needed to determine efficacy. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Avifavir, a generic form of favipiravir, is an antiviral medication primarily used to treat severe cases of influenza. This medication is currently being studied in several countries as a potential experimental treatment for COVID-19, but we do not yet have enough evidence to determine whether or not Avifavir is an effective treatment for the virus. \n\nRecently in Russia, the health ministry approved the medication's use as a COVID-19 treatment by using an accelerated, short-term form of clinical trial with fewer people involved than traditional studies normally require. However, this study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal so the data, methods, and other study characteristics have yet to critiqued or evaluated by other scientists.\n\nThough this research is still occurring in the country, Russia's preliminary results suggested Avifavir might help reduce the number of days people are infected with the virus and shorten the duration of time people experience high-grade fevers while sick. \nBut until more studies are completed and a greater amount of data can demonstrate Avifavir's efficacy and safety, we do not have enough information to determine whether or not this medication can help treat COVID-19.\n",

    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Rhodiola and forsythia are plants used in traditional Chinese medicine which have not been scientifically or clinically proven to prevent or treat COVID-19. While the use of traditional Chinese medicine is widespread in China and has been promoted by some government entities like the China National Health Commission, the World Health Organization warns that inappropriate use of traditional medicine can have negative health impacts and that more research is needed to determine the efficacy as well as safety of many traditional medicine practices. Traditional Chinese medicine is a branch of traditional medicine based on historical Chinese health practices passed through generations, including herbal medicines, acupuncture, and other techniques. Traditional medicine is used around the world but is considered a form of alternative medicine, different from formalized and science-based conventional medical care. Beyond safety and efficacy concerns for traditional medicine, there are also concerns about the use of certain species in traditional medicine that could lead to loss of biodiversity.\n",
    "What our experts say": "While there are historical uses for these herbal treatments, there have been no peer-reviewed studies to support the use of rhodiola, forsythia, or other tradtional Chinese medicines for COVID-19. Rhodiola is often used for stress, but has not been proven effective in treating COVID-19. Following the announcement from a Chinese official regarding approval of three herbal supplements for treatment, there was widespread concern regarding the lack of rigorous studies to support their use. As the outbreak is just six months old, it is important to stress that there is no proven treatment and many studies are being done to address these information gaps. \n",

    "Source of the question": [

    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "Canada"
    ],
    "Background and context": "News headlines have mentioned llamas participating in research with the potential to help treat and prevent COVID-19. Animals ranging from llamas to sharks have been used to help produce antibodies similar to those used by human immune systems. Camelids, including llamas, camels, and alpacas, are particularly effective at antibody production and make simpler and smaller \"single-domain\" antibodies that are called nanobodies.  According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, special features of nanobodies include stability for storage of therapeutics and the potential for delivery through an inhaler directly to the lungs, which may be beneficial for respiratory diseases like COVID-19. There is widespread interest in antibodies against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, for use in helping infected patients recover and protecting more people from getting sick. \n\nIn 2016, researchers from the University of Texas worked with a Belgian research team to study the effect of an injection of a type of coronavirus in a 4-year-old llama named Winter. Though the virus was similar to COVID-19, it was not exactly the same. In this early study, the virus that caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was used. The goal of this injection was to see if Winter's body might produce nanobodies in response to exposure to this coronavirus. Luckily, Winter produced two antibodies: one that fought off MERS and the other that fought off SARS. The scientists further studied the antibodies in a lab and were eventually able to use them to produce nanobodies, which might help prevent SARS and MERS viruses once they enter a body's cells. The current research into llamas to treat COVID-19 stems from this process. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Llamas are being used in research to produce antibodies that _may_ help develop therapeutics to treat and prevent COVID-19 in humans. Like humans, llamas naturally produce antibodies. Antibodies are special proteins that are made from plasma cells (a type of white blood cell), and they help the body to fight \"antigens\" including viruses, bacteria, and other threats that can make people sick. \n\nLlamas are able to produce a special type of antibody called a 'nanobody.' Nanobodies are about a quarter of the size of the antibodies that humans produce and, because they are so small, nanobodies are more stable, can live for a long time, and are able reach tiny, hard-to-reach areas of the body to help treat infected cells. Using a known process, scientists are looking to create a treatment for COVID-19 using llama nanobodies. Though animal studies have only just begun and researchers are not yet ready for human studies, there is hope that COVID-19 antibody treatments made possible by llamas could become preventive in the future. \n",

    "Question": "What do we know about why COVID-19 impacts Black communities in the U.S. more aggressively than others?",
    "Status": "Published",

    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & disparities",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Recent studies have demonstrated how COVID-19 disproportionately impacts Black people in cities across the United States. This has caused many journalists to highlight how, while the pandemic is affecting everyone, there are major demographic differences in who is most at-risk, and what resources people have to cope. In response, advocates are calling for COVID-19 response and recovery policies to be tailored accordingly, to make sure different communities have the support they need. Beyond health impacts, Black communities can also face more economic disruptions during the pandemic, impacted by both current and historical racial injustices. The recent wave of protests in solidarity with the Movement for Black Lives is raising awareness about multiple issues affecting Black communities, many of which intersect with the pandemic.\n",
    "What our experts say": "The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black communities in the United States, especially as a result of existing structural and racial disparities in the healthcare system, is well documented. Despite comprising only 22% of New York City’s population, Black Americans constituted 28% of fatalities from the virus as of mid-April. In Chicago, Black Americans account for 30% of the population, but suffer 70% of reported COVID-19 fatalities. This is likely due to several factors. Racial disparities in access to healthcare contribute to lower quality care for Black populations. Black Americans are more likely to live in densely populated neighborhoods with limited healthcare access. Density can heighten exposure to the virus. \n\nBlack Americans also face higher rates of pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, which heighten the risk of complications from COVID-19. They are also overrepresented in essential professions that are more likely to face routine interactions with people and a higher exposure level to the virus. Finally, research suggests Black populations face racial bias in the healthcare system and are less likely to have access to timely testing, which may also contribute to a higher rate of mortality from the virus. Such factors have contributed to higher COVID-19 mortality rates among Black populations and reflect the disproportionate and devastating impact of COVID-19 on communities of color. \n",

    "Question": "What is the context behind the incorrect claim on social media associating a decrease in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome with a decrease in immunization rates of infants during COVID-19? ",
    "Status": "Do not publish",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "UK"
    ],
    "Background and context": "This comes from an incorrect claim that is trying to make the case that infant vaccines cause Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and that a reduction of vaccination coverage in infants during the pandemic due to lockdown is the reason for lower cases of SIDS. The origin of this misinformation is not a new myth. In fact, the WHO listed the myth that the Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine causes SIDS as one of six common misconceptions about immunization. In the Health Choice report, where this erroneous claim comes from, authors take two pieces of standalone information (that infant vaccine rates have decreased during the pandemic, and that rates of SIDS have decreased during COVID-19 pandemic, respectively) and claim causality between the two phenomena without a) referencing any study that would be needed to prove causality, and b) without sufficient evidence that SIDS rates have, in fact, decreased. It is possible that these two pieces of data happen to be true at the same time but are entirely disconnected. The attempt to connect these two pieces of information without any evidence base for doing so is known as ecological fallacy, and is a common tactic used among anti-vaccine communities online.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Linking a decrease in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) to a decrease in the immunization rate of infants in the U.S. would be factually misleading. Rates of SIDS and immunization have to be understood to be independent of one another until proven otherwise. So far, no studies have linked the two rates. There is also no published data on SIDS during the pandemic so far. One white paper makes claims that SIDS has decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic based on “anecdotal evidence”, i.e. hearsay, which is not considered to be scientific evidence. As a result, scientists do not know what effect COVID-19 has had on SIDS, if any at all. As for immunization, on May 18th 2020, the US CDC reported that vaccination rates declined across children age groups, except for newborns receiving the hepatitis B vaccine at the hospital around the time of birth. \n",

    "Question": "Is it safe to wear a mask?",
    "Status": "Published",

    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & masks",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "In the early phases of the COVID-19 outbreak, masks were not recommended as a standard measure to prevent the spread of infection. Because critical protective equipment (including masks) was reserved primarily for healthcare workers, many health organizations could not advocate for the use of masks by the general public until the needs of medical teams were met. Additionally, there was a lack of evidence regarding different types of masks needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Early in the outbreak, the new virus had also not been thoroughly investigated by teams focused on respiratory droplets and aerosolized particles with masks. As scientists and medical experts have learned more about the virus and its spread, the use of face masks to prevent illness as a result of COVID-19 has become a routine recommendation in many parts of the world.\n\nFace masks and cloth face coverings, in combination with frequent hand-washing and social distancing measures, have been shown to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Face mask safety also includes carefully and safely putting on, wearing, and removing the mask. The mask should cover both the nose and mouth, and it should be snug against the face.  It is important not to touch the outside of mask while it is worn or when it is removed, and hand washing before and after mask removal is recommended.  Finally, according to the World Health Organization, cloth masks should be washed daily.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Wearing a face mask is both safe and recommended to slow the spread of COVID-19. The United States Centers for Disease Control  recommends widespread use of cloth face coverings to prevent spread from people who might have the virus that causes COVID-19 without realizing it. While surgical masks and N-95 masks are in short supply and should be reserved for healthcare workers, cloth face coverings should always be worn when interacting with other people in close proximity (including but not limited to grocery shopping, ordering food at a restaurant, interacting with people within 6 feet in outdoor spaces). \n\nYou should clean your hands before touching the mask, make sure the mask covers your nose and mouth, and ensure the mask fits tightly on your face without leaving exposed spaces. Additionally, you should avoid touching the front of the mask, avoid taking the mask off when talking to other people; only remove the mask by touching the straps; wash your hands after removing the mask; wash the mask in soap and detergent with hot water at least once a day; and avoid sharing masks with others or leaving used masks around other people. While mask wearing is recognized as safe and is advised by the World Health Organization and other leading health advisory groups, there are cases where masks should not be used. For instance, masks are not safe for children under 2 years of age, people who have trouble breathing in general, or individuals who are unconscious or who would be unable to remove the mask without help. \n\nSeveral cities and states, such as New Orleans and Washington, have mandated the use of face masks to slow the spread of the virus. However, masks alone are not enough. In addition to wearing a mask to help stop the spread of the virus, public health experts encourage social distancing (staying at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others) as well as frequent and thorough hand washing. \n",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Over the past few months, there have been news stories about virus outbreaks at U.S. meat processing facilities. With many ill workers, some meat processing facilities closed temporarily, which resulted in a decrease in meat and pork in markets and grocery stores. \n\nPeople who live or work in places where they are close to other people are at increased risk of getting and spreading COVID-19. While separating employees from one another by at least 6 feet (2 meters) or implementing COVID-19 specific sanitation guidelines have been effective in controlling spread of the virus in some work environments, these control measures have been difficult to implement in meat/pork processing facilities.  Furthermore, employee attendance and sick leave policies, crowded living conditions, and limited protective equipment availability and use may also contribute to COVID-19 spread. To reduce the spread of COVID-19 in meat/pork processing facilities, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests using routine symptom screening as well as “improving physical distancing, hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfection, and medical leave policies, and providing educational materials in languages spoken by workers.”\n",
    "What our experts say": "Meat processing plants have become major hotspots for coronavirus outbreaks because employees work in close proximity to one another, which makes social distancing very difficult. Across the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that 4,913 COVID-19 cases and 20 deaths have been reported among approximately 130,000 workers at 115 meat processing facilities in 19 states. Many meat processing plants have failed to provide basic protections like face masks, plexiglass barriers between workers, or paid sick leave to frontline employees. The Tyson Fresh Meats Plant in Washington State, the largest meat-packing plant in the state, was temporarily closed in April after more than a 100 employees tested positive for COVID-19. The plant has since resumed operations after testing all employees, but unions and health officials alike have advocated for greater health protections for workers, including adequate social distancing measures, even if it slows operations. \n",

    "Background and context": "As we move forward with the COVID-19 pandemic and related research, more information will become available about the role of genomics. Currently, there is significant interest on the role of ACE receptors, inhibitors and infection. \n",
    "What our experts say": "We're still learning more about the role of genetics in COVID-19 infection, both in terms of susceptibility, but also severity of illness. There have been some studies that have looked at proteins, called \"toll-like receptors\" or \"TLRs\" that help an immune system detect a virus and alert the immune system to begin defending the body from infection. Those studies have looked at the role of TLRs in natural immunity to the virus, and how our genes controlling a protein involved in TLR response, plays into susceptibility. Other studies have assessed blood types and that those with Type A appear to have a higher risk of contracting the virus, whereas Type O might be protective. \n\nACE receptors - also known as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors - might be the way the virus gets into the cell and may play a large role in the virus's ability to infect cells. Because of this, there has been increased research into genetic variants in these receptors. It is likely that some genetics play a role in COVID-19 infection and clinical manifestations, but it will take much more research to understand these relationships. \n",

    "Question": "Is favipiravir effective in treating COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "The context for favipiravir is the same as for avifavir, given that avifavir is a generic form of favipiravir. Favipiravir as a potential COVID-19 treatment has been emerging in visibility given that delivery of the drug to Russian hospitals began in June, following the approval of the Russian Ministry of Health. The approval follows promising but limited studies on favipiravir's accuracy in Russia, carried out in partnership of The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, and the ChemRar Group. Studies on the drug had also been conducted in China -- with seemingly promising results yet severe study limitations -- as well as in the US, Italy, Japan and India. Favipiravir works by selectively inhibiting RNA polymerase, necessary for viral replication, but data on its efficacy for COVID-19 is still inconclusive. 60,000 doses of the drug are set to be administered by the end of the month, according to RDIF. Trends in Russia's COVID-19 data, and in particular, additional evidence, are needed to determine efficacy. Though only approved for influenza treatment in Japan, the drug has also been tested with varying levels of accuracy for treatment of Ebola, Zika, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, and Rift Valley fever, among other diseases. \n",
    "What our experts say": "There is not enough evidence right now to know whether or not favipiravir, also known as Avigan, can help treat COVID-19. Favipiravir is a drug that is used as an influenza medication in Japan and China, and is currently in studies to treat other viral infections, including COVID-19, in many other countries. Early studies involving favipiravir showed promising results in reducing the duration of symptoms of COVID-19 and aiding in the recovery of patients. However, there were shortcomings to these studies as well, like only having a small number of patients involved and the presence of age differences between study groups. Additionally, participants in the study were not randomly assigned to their groups (called randomization) and study subjects and their doctors both knew which treatments they received and didn't receive. This might help explain why there is no consensus as to whether or not favipiravir is an effect treatment for COVID-19 at this time.\n",

    "Background and context": "Sewage contains valuable information on human health as viruses, bacteria, and chemical metabolites are excreted in urine and stool and provide a readout of an individual’s health status. In some diseases, people excrete viruses before they show symptoms, meaning that sewage can provide an early indicator of disease spread before people start seeking care. The technical term for analyzing sewage as a source of public health information is [Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE)][1]. \n(Source: [Biobot Analytics][2])\n\n  [1]: https://cen.acs.org/environment/water/monitor-health-citiesresidents-look-further/96/i18\n  [2]: https://www.biobot.io/\n",
    "What our experts say": "SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19. It leaves the human body through our waste, so flushing the toilet with that waste means traces of the virus can be found in  sewage water. This is why COVID-19 has been recently detected in sewage water in regions that have tested for it. By collecting water from sewers, scientists in the U.S. and Europe are now testing sewage for the virus, using it as a collective sample to measure infection levels among thousands of people. Recent studies have shown that sewage water can be used as an early diagnostic tool for determining where potential COVID-19 cases might be occurring in a city. A recent study showed that measuring virus levels in municipal sewage helped researchers predict where forthcoming COVID-19 cases would be coming from a week before people began testing positive for the virus in that area. They did this by comparing the amount of virus found in the sewage water with the amount of confirmed cases in an area's hospitals. \nWe have observed that estimating the true number of COVID-19 cases is extremely challenging; these estimates often lead to underestimating the true scope of the pandemic in a community because many people are never tested for the virus even if they are ill. Moreover, asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms may never seek out testing and therefore won't be counted; but they can still transmit the virus. In this context, measuring overall virus levels in sewage over time could indicate the scope of the pandemic; indicate whether an outbreak is growing or shrinking; and can act as a surveillance system that would allow to detect new waves of an outbreak before patients develop symptoms and go to hospitals. \n\n(Source: [Biobot Analytics][1])\n\n  [1]: https://www.biobot.io/\n",

    "Source of the question": [

      "India"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on migrant laborers are being documented globally as a result of poor or crowded working conditions, inadequate living conditions, risk of contracting the virus while traveling for work, and low access to quality healthcare, among other factors. Migratory and seasonal agricultural workers (MSAWs) have been documented to disproportionately infectious diseases, like COVID-19, along with a host of other serious health problems including diabetes, malnutrition, infectious diseases, pesticide poisoning, and injuries from work-related machinery. These health issues are exacerbated by the transitory culture of this population group, which makes it difficult to develop a relationship with a healthcare provider, maintain treatment regimens, and track health records. For these reasons, MSAWs were inequitably impacted by India's sudden shut down, and by the sudden reopening. \nSource: <https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/migrant-health>\n",
    "What our experts say": "India enacted one of the toughest nationwide lockdown policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and shut down all travel and movement with barely four hours notice on March 24, 2020. The lockdown disproportionately impacted the informal sector of India (the part of any economy that is not regulated by the government), and left thousands of migrant laborers and daily wage earners stranded. With buses and trains shuttered, migrant laborers had to walk hundreds of kilometers back to their villages, and many died along the way. \n\nIndia's COVID-19 response has been criticized for inadequately accounting for the needs of the most marginalized and vulnerable residents who lacked resources to cope with the abrupt lockdown. Now that the lockdown has ended, the Supreme Court of India has ordered states to identify stranded migrant laborers and facilitate their return to their hometowns. Several states, including West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar, and Jharkhand, have reported spikes in infections as more than 10 million migrant workers return to their homes following the easing of lockdown measures. The actual impact of migration on COVID-19 cases is difficult to ascertain, since testing has also improved, but the sudden influx of migrant laborers has made it even more difficult for the state healthcare institutions to treat and care for COVID-19 cases.\n",

    "Question": "Could the oral polio vaccine be a solution for Covid-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "Kenya"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Drug repurposing is a safe, and often successful, pathway to speed up drug discovery and development compared with starting from scratch. Drug repurposing uses drugs that have either received regulatory approval, have failed in clinical trials, or are in later stages of clinical trials, in order to leverage the detailed information collected on safety, toxicity, formulation, manufacturing plans, etc. There are many existing drugs that are undergoing testing for being repurposed for COVID-19 treatment, as well as many existing vaccines being studied for repurpose for COVID-19 prevention. For instance, biopharmaceutical company Merck is working on development of an experimental Covid-19 vaccine based on a measles vaccine. Another group is studying the effectiveness of Tuberculosis vaccine Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) in protecting healthcare workers from COVID-19; and Company Emergent BioSolutions is in pre-clinical development of studying anti-SARS antibodies for COVID-19 prevention. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) is another option being tested based on indicators from past studies that OPV has helpful, general triggers for the immune system. According to the Polio Eradication Initiative, “A study is currently being discussed with various partners and vaccine manufacturers, including the US FDA, the outcomes of which will be carefully assessed to determine potential use in the context of the spread of SARS-CoV2 until the time when specific vaccines and antiviral therapies are ready.”\n",
    "What our experts say": "It's too early to know. Successful discovery and safe delivery of a vaccine are very challenging. In the pandemic context we are in, many scientists are turning to existing drugs and vaccines to try and see if they can repurpose them to tackle COVID-19, especially since their safety profiles, side effects, and effectiveness are already known. Similarly, the safety track record of the oral polio vaccine is also known, and scientists are now studying its efficacy against COVID-19. The hypothesis these scientists have suggested is that the oral polio vaccine – a weakened version of the live polio virus – is assumed to trigger a general immune response in the body - production of antibodies against a foreign organism to be protected in the future if infected again with the same organism. When the body's immune system engages this response to fight off the unknown virus, scientists believe the body will develop antibodies specific to the novel coronavirus, the virus that causes COVID-19. However these are early studies occurring in animal models only at this stage and with no results yet. Moreover, there is no consensus yet among scientists as to whether choosing the oral polio vaccine as a candidate was a good idea in the first place. Some note that there are risks in introducing the oral polio vaccine in some populations which is why in most of the world, doctors have phased out the oral formulation in favor of the inactivated polio vaccine, which is more widely used today.\n",

    "Question": "Why has India reported a significant surge in cases of COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Transmission",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & transmission",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "India"
    ],
    "Background and context": "India's stringent lockdown measures helped to control the spread of COVID-19 and significantly reduced the rate at which infections doubled by more than half from 4 days to 10 days. However, lockdown measures were lifted right as the country reported a significant surge of cases, particularly populous cities like Delhi and Mumbai, and states like Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Public health experts indicate that lockdown measures in India ended too quickly, just as cases started spiking. The initial lockdown was in effect for 21 days from March 24, 2020, and was extended to May 31, 2020. Following May 31, 2020, the country opened up in phases, and only a few areas continued to place restrictions on movement. Crowded means of transportation, densely packed neighborhoods, and inadequate social distancing have contributed to a steep rise in infections, made worse by a premature end to the lockdown. The end of the lockdown has also sparked a mass exodus of migrant laborers back to their home states, which local health authorities worry has driven the rise in new cases. It's too soon to tell whether the spike in new cases has actually been driven by migrant laborers—increased testing availability has allowed for more cases to be detected, which may also contribute to the increased case count. Experts from the Indian Council of Medical Research noted that India has still not reached the peak of infections, and that cases are likely to continue to rise in the future.\n",

    "Source of the question": [

    ],
    "Background and context": "Tear gas refers to a group of chemical irritants that are designed to irritate mucous membranes, and cause people to tear, cough, and sneeze. It is used as a method of crowd dispersal during protests. During the recent protests in the United States in the wake of George Floyd's death, police departments across the country used tear gas widely in an effort to disperse crowds. This was widely criticized as a counter-productive and dangerous means of crowd dispersal during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "Tear gas and other chemical irritants can cause people to cough, sneeze, and take off their face masks, which can increase the spread of COVID-19. This is the case both for people who have symptoms of the virus and those who might not have any symptoms and don't know they are sick. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads primarily through droplets that are emitted when people exhale, cough, or spit. Tear gas can cause people to cough or scream loudly, which could carry the virus particles much farther than 6 feet (2m) and infect others around them. In addition to inducing coughing, tear gas has also been linked to increased susceptibility to infection in the respiratory tract as well as increased pain and inflammation. A 2014 study found that exposure to tear gas contributed to a significantly higher risk of acute respiratory illnesses (sudden and serious respiratory illnesses). More than 1200 infectious disease and public health professionals have signed a petition opposing the use of tear gas and other respiratory irritants during this pandemic.\n",

    "What our experts say": "The renewed focus on the COVID-19 pandemic and its heavy toll has worried health experts about other infectious disease programs in low- and middle-income countries, such as the distribution of insecticide-treated bednets in sub-Saharan Africa or routine vaccination programs in India. A new modeling analysis released by the World Health Organization shows that disruptions to bednet distribution campaigns could double the number of malaria deaths in 2020 compared to the amount of deaths in 2018 (in the worst case scenario). Health experts are warning that existing vaccination programs or other vector control programs (such as indoor spraying or insecticide-treated bednet distribution campaigns) should be accelerated to prevent other infectious disease outbreaks, even as resources are focused on the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

    "Country question was sourced from": [

    ],
    "Background and context": "Respiratory viruses are primarily spread through infectious respiratory droplets (coughing, sneezing, and sometimes talking). Close contact (within 6 feet/2 meters) for a prolonged period of time (15 minutes or more) without respiratory protection is considered an exposure risk for COVID-19. While we don't know what the number of cases related to large gatherings, like the recent protests, will look like, it is likely that there will be some. Protestors are encouraged to not only utilize infection prevention measures, but also quarantine at home for 14 days after protesting. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Large gatherings of people in close contact for a prolonged period of time does increase risk for transmission of respiratory viruses. Outdoor protests allow for natural ventilation, and the additional use of masks, eye protection, and social distancing efforts can help reduce risk. While it is unknown if protests will lead to a large increase in the number of cases, it is possible there will be additional cases in the 2 weeks following protests. \n",

    "Question": "Does wearing gloves protect against or stop the spread of COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Fact-checking organization"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "Nigeria"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Sterile gloves, when properly worn and properly disposed of, can be a helpful element in protecting against infectious disease. However, if a person is not wearing gloves correctly, not putting them on correctly, or not disposing of them correctly, it defeats the purpose of wearing gloves. It is important to remember that any germs that someone comes into contact with, can be on a person's gloves, and can then be transferred to any other surface that the gloves touch. It also can give people a false sense of security while wearing gloves, and can result in people touching surfaces and items more freely, then touching their faces, which can lead to self-contamination with the virus. Wearing gloves is only an effective protection when the person wearing them follows the right protective methods. If they aren't followed, it can lead to contamination with a virus. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Wearing gloves does not directly protect against spread of the virus. COVID-19 is thought to spread primarily through small drops of moisture (respiratory droplets) that are released when a person infected with COVID-19 coughs, talks, or sneezes. Those drops can then land on the faces of people, surfaces, and items nearby. Wearing new and sterile gloves is not as effective as 20 seconds of hand washing with soap and water, but they can help you avoid touching an infected surface or item with your bare hands. Keep in mind that gloves can only prevent infection if you **don't touch your face** with your gloved hands, and only if **you take off and dispose of the gloves correctly** before washing your hands. \nIt is also important to remember to touch as few surfaces and items as possible if you are wearing gloves in order to avoid contaminating surfaces and spreading COVID-19 to more people. Remember that the best way to prevent spreading or getting infected with COVID-19 is through washing your bare hands for 20 seconds with water and soap, maintaining at least six feet of physical distance between yourself and others, and regularly washing and disinfecting surfaces in your household.\nFor people caring for, or in contact with, people who have been infected with COVID-19, wearing gloves can help make sure the caretaker doesn't touch dangerous substances that come from the sick person's body, like mucus from a sneeze, urine, blood, feces, or other fluids. \n",

    "Question": "What does it mean for a study to be a pre-print?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Research",
    "Subcategory": "On: Pre-print studies",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background and context": "To be considered high quality, valid, significant, original, and suitable for publication in a scientific journal, studies must complete a peer-review process. As these published studies could potentially influence clinical practices and public health behaviour, this process acts as a filter to ensure every study meets the strict requirements of each journal, causing many studies not to be accepted or published once they go through peer reviews. Pre-print studies have not yet passed the peer-review process so scientists urge caution not to draw any conclusions from pre-print studies. \nThe peer review and publication processes are time-consuming, frequently involving more than a year between submission and publication. The process is also highly competitive. \nPeer-reviewed articles provide a trusted form of scientific communication. Even if you are unfamiliar with the topic or the scientists who authored a particular study, you can trust peer-reviewed work to meet certain standards of scientific quality. Since scientific knowledge is cumulative and builds on itself, this trust is particularly important.\nAfter submission of a pre-print study to a journal, the journal's editors send the article to several other scientists who work in the same field (i.e., the \"peers\" of peer review). Those reviewers provide feedback on the article and tell the editor whether or not they think the study is of high enough quality to be published. The authors may then revise their article and resubmit it for consideration. Only articles that meet good scientific standards (e.g., acknowledge and build upon other work in the field, rely on logical reasoning and well-designed studies, back up claims with evidence, etc.) are accepted for publication.\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "Pre-print studies are studies that have been completed but haven't gone through the peer-review process that most scientific journals require for publishing.\nPre-prints provide new data and information, which is important in a pandemic. However the details in a pre-print study, such as: how the study was designed and conducted, what sample sizes were included, what assumptions were made, and how calculations were done, have not been scrutinized by the journal's reviewers and editors. The process of scrutinizing a pre-print study is what the peer-review process consist of. Most websites that publish pre-print articles suggest that these articles should not be reported in the news as established information or used to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior. \nUntil the studies are scrutinized by reviewers, they should not be assumed to be factually correct or inform any actions.\n",

    "Background and context": "Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses which are not particularly environmentally hardy. This means that the virus causing COVID-19 is susceptible to a wide range of cleaning and disinfection products and in direct sunlight, begins to break down within a few minutes. There has been no detection of COVID-19 in drinking water and per the CDC, water filtration and disinfection methods should remove or inactive any existing viral particles in the water. While COVID-19 is not spread through water, there are other viruses and bacteria that can be spread in pool water, such as norovirus, which means it is important to maintain safe levels of chlorine and water treatment.\n",
    "What our experts say": "The virus that causes COVID-19 is spread through respiratory secretions like a cough or a sneeze. While it can also be transmitted through contaminated surfaces and objects (e.g. contaminated door handle), there has been no evidence that it can be spread through water in pools, hot tubs, spas, or water play areas. Moreover, the virus has not been detected in drinking water. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the biggest concern for COVID-19 transmission around pools is related to crowded areas where social distancing cannot occur and the importance of hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette due to many high-touch surfaces and objects. In relation to pools, exposure prevention is focused more on respiratory droplets from other people visiting the pool rather than the water itself.\n",

    "Question": "What is the latest research around sunbathing and COVID-19?",

    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA",
      "Canada"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Recent news articles and studies have focused on people sunbathing as a way to prevent or treat COVID-19. There has been no evidence that sunbathing is effective at combatting COVID-19. \nUltraviolet or UV rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation, present in sunlight. Sunlight emits three kinds of UV rays: UVA, UVB, and UVC. UVC has the highest energy and is filtered by the atmosphere so it does not reach the Earth's surface.\nHowever, UVC rays can also come from some man-made sources, such as UV sanitizing bulbs, and be used in indoor settings, such as hospitals, to disinfect medical equipment and surfaces. This is because UVC has the most energy of the three, and its energy can destroy the genetic material inside viruses. The genetic material in viruses includes information that can control the reproduction, development or behaviour of the virus. But artificial UVC rays are extremely dangerous and deadly to humans and should not be used outside of professional settings to disinfect surfaces and objects.\nAs for the general sunlight, while the sun can kill germs, disinfecting items through sunlight would not be 100% effective and would take a very long time and most household users would not be able to confirm that their items had been fully disinfected during this process. Studies have shown that there are different lengths of time of sun exposure needed for items to be disinfected depending on size, material, etc. Exposure to sunlight is therefore not a recommended solution for disinfecting routine household items. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Exposing yourself to the sun for any period of time does not prevent anyone from spreading COVID-19 to another person or catching COVID-19 from another person. Long-term exposure to sunlight can be very damaging and increase your risk of skin cancer. As of now, there is no clear benefit of sunbathing for preventing or treating COVID-19. \n\n",

    "Question": "Can COVID-19 be spread through money?",
    "Status": "Published",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "Mexico"
    ],
    "Background and context": "Money, including coins and bills, has been for a long time considered a potential way diseases are transmitted from one person to another, although we do not have strong evidence to support that claim. The idea is that germs would \"attach\" themselves to bills and then be transmitted by traveling along the hand-money-hand route. This can represent a public health risk especially during simultaneous handling of food and money, or when touching money and then touching our face without having washed our hands. \nThe current discussion around money as a potential way of spreading diseases is based on studies that found that several types of bacteria can survive on paper money depending on some factors (type of paper, humidity, etc.). However, no strong evidence exists yet around transmission from contaminated money to our bodies.\nSome news outlets previously reported that the World Health Organization (WHO) claimed you could contract the virus that causes COVID-19 from coins and banknotes (paper money). However, the WHO clarified and said this claim had been misrepresented; the WHO did not issue any kind of warning or statement about COVID-19 transmission through coins and banknotes. Instead, they have emphasized the importance of washing hands with soap, especially before handling or eating food. \n",
    "What our experts say": "The virus that causes COVID-19 can potentially be spread through money. However, it's unlikely to cause the COVID-19 illness in humans. A recent study has shown that the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive on solid surfaces like coins for up to four days and on paper like cash for up to three hours, but the virus was no longer infectious (viable) after that point. There has been no rigorous research to conclude or disprove that COVID-19 can be easily spread through coins and paper money otherwise. Therefore, the risk of catching COVID-19 from the virus sticking to money is very low. \nHowever, it is best practice in general to wash your hands and avoid touching your face after touching money. The virus that causes COVID-19 is primarily spread through person-to-person contact, especially if you are in close contact with another person (within about 6 feet or 2 meters). Since we do not yet fully understand all the ways the virus could spread, it would be a good practice to be vigilant with money just as any other potential contaminated surface, and wash your hands with soap after touching it. \n",

Some other viruses can be shared through sexual contact, or by sharing needles that have been contaminated by bodily fluids. \n",
    "What our experts say": "There have been no documented cases of sexual transmission. Based on the evidence available right now, experts do not know whether COVID-19 can spread from person to person through bodily fluids that are not respiratory functions like talking, coughing and sneezing. Some confusion around this could be because traces of the virus that causes COVID-19 were found in the semen samples of 6 out of 38 men who provided samples in a research study. According to the study, four of the six men were still infected, while two were recovering. This does not mean that COVID-19 is sexually transmitted. Traces of the virus have also been found in other bodily fluids and stool samples, but it is unclear whether the virus can spread from person to person through sexual transmission.\n",

COVID-19 is a disease that is a type of coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Because viruses and bacteria are different, the illnesses that they cause cannot be treated by the same type of medication. Antibiotics cannot be used to treat viral infections like COVID-19.  \n",

Viruses and bacterial infections cause different types of illnesses, and antibiotics are only effective in treating bacterial infections, not viruses like COVID-19. Antibiotics should not be taken as a way to prevent or treat COVID-19 and they should not be taken unless prescribed by a doctor.
