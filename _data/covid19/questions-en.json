    ],
    "Background & context": "The outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States was first reported in long-term care facilities, also called nursing homes, in Washington state in February 2020. These early outbreaks involved people over the age fo 65, often with underlying health conditions like heart disease or breathing problems, which means the COVID-19 risks faced by these groups were numerous. Additionally, nursing homes are housed in enclosed buildings and have staff members that care for multiple residents making these facilities excellent hosts for viral spreading. Shortly before February, staff members and the family members of nursing home residents traveled often around the country and internationally and were not self-isolating since the United States had not had a substantial outbreak at this time. This likely allowed cases to spread rapidly from staff and family members to residents of nursing homes.\n\nIn response to these early nursing home outbreaks, several government agencies that oversee these facilities and the nursing homes themselves created stricter policies to prevent the future spread of the virus. Since then, conditions have improved in many facilities, but more research needs to be completed to completely understand the reasons for these initial outbreaks.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Nursing homes, like long-term care facilities, are uniquely vulnerable to COVID-19 transmission. COVID-19 is like many other respiratory viruses and can easily be transmitted between people in enclosed spaces. This is why we consider these facilities high risk for transmission. \nSince many residents at nursing homes have preexisting conditions (i.e. heart disease or breathing problems) they are at a greater risk for severe disease if they get COVID-19. \nMore research has shown that COVID-19 infections were common in nursing homes, for both residents and staff, as nursing homes often do not have enough resources dedicated to infection prevention like guidelines to follow, dedicated staff members, and specific equipment. In addition, the shared living spaces like cafeterias and group rooms make it hard to isolate patients. Nursing homes are vulnerable areas for COVID-19 transmission. \n",

    "Question": "What is the difference between exposure and infection to a virus?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background & context": "We are exposed to viruses, chemicals, sunlight, and many other things every day. In general, exposure suggests that someone has been in an area where they may have come into contact with a foreign substance called a pathogen (a virus, bacteria, or other tiny organism) that can cause a disease. In the case of COVID-19, the pathogen is a respiratory virus. \n\nAn infection happens when a pathogen that causes an illness gets into our body (i.e. lungs, skin, eyes, throat, stomach, blood). A virus may enter the body through contact with mucous membranes. These membranes are tissues in the body that line parts of your ear, eyes, nose, throat, digestive tract and other parts of the body that are exposed to air like wounds on the skin. Once the virus enters the body, it enters into cells and is able to spread and cause inflammation. Inflammation causes a person to develop symptoms of infection. Common symptoms of COVID-19 infection include fever, fatigue, cough, and shortness of breath. But scientists are discovering new symptoms associated with COVID-19 every day.\n\nFor COVID-19, some people who are exposed to the virus never become infected. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that there is an increased risk of infection for people who are exposed to the virus by being in close contact (within 6 feet or about 2 meters for 15 minutes or longer) with an infected person. The time between exposure to the virus and the appearance of symptoms of infection is currently being studied by many researchers, but we are still learning about this process. For people who become ill with COVID-19, research has shown that symptoms of infection usually begin about five days after someone is exposed to the virus, and 97.5% of people who are exposed to the virus will show symptoms within 11.5 days.\n",
    "What our experts say": "When it comes to infectious diseases, \"exposure\" means coming into contact with a virus or bacteria. Infection happens when someone is exposed and actually becomes sick from the exposure. Exposure does not always lead to an infection. If the time a person is exposed to the virus is very short, if the amount of virus that enters the body is not in a large enough quantity, or if the body's immune system is able to quickly fight it off, then exposure will be less likely to lead to infection. \n\nMany things have to happen for an exposure to result in an infection, especially the ways in which a person was exposed to the virus. In the case of the virus that causes COVID-19, exposure takes place usually by breathing in the virus through the nose or the mouth, and sometimes the virus enters our bodies through the eyes. People can be \"exposed\" to different viruses in different ways, such as by eating food with a virus on it, or getting bit by a mosquito or other animal that carries a virus. Again, in the case of COVID-19, exposure typically happens by breathing in the virus through the nose or the mouth.\n\nOther factors that can impact whether an exposure leads to an infection include whether the germ is a virus, a bacteria or a parasite; how strong or \"infectious\" it is; and the strength of our body defense system (immune system). \n\nFor example, you could be exposed to whooping cough (pertussis) by someone in the same room as you, but whether or not you end up being infected depends on several factors. These factors include how close to the person you were, how long you were exposed for, and if you are vaccinated against whooping cough.\n",

    "Background & context": "Recently, a huge amount of misinformation has come out regarding face masks and their potential impacts on people. Since the World Health Organization and U.S. CDC have recommended wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19,Â face masks have become a target of political discussions. This is likely due to the fact that in the early months of 2020, face masks were not yet recommended by these groups for a number of reasons, including a lack of evidence that they would be effective (since then research has been conducted and we have proof of their effectiveness) and a general shortage of masks for doctors and healthcare professionals. As more research studies were completed and more evidence made it clear that face masks were effective in helping the spread of COVID-19, the face mask policies also changed.\n",
    "What our experts say": "No. There is no proof that wearing a mask can reduce oxygen levels, also known as hypoxia. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) recommend wearing cloth masks in public, which are not too tight on our faces and allow for easy breathing.\n\nEven doctors and healthcare professionals wearing N95 masks (which fit very tightly around the face and are made to create a seal around the edge of the mask) are not at risk of hypoxia. However, for any person with preexisting lung or breathing problems in general, they should speak with their doctors about their concerns regarding masks. \n",

    "Question": "Is there a cure for COVID-19? What is the cure?\n",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Treatment",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & treatments",
    "Background & context": "The word 'cure' is a broad one that technically means a procedure or drug that ends a certain medical condition, and implies a complete restoration of health. The word 'treatment,' on the other hand, technically means a procedure or drug that improves a certain medical condition, but doesn't necessarily end it. This distinction is important because there is currently no cure for COVID-19, but there are treatments in use, namely Remdesivir, which is under emergency use authorization (EUA) by the U.S. FDA, and Dexamethasone, which was previously approved by the FDA to treat a range of other health conditions. None of these treatments, however, are officially approved for COVID-19. There are multiple studies being conducted around the world to test a variety of cures, treatments, and preventative vaccines for COVID-19.\n",
    "What our experts say": "As of July 28, 2020, there is no known cure for COVID-19, but there are ways to manage the symptoms of the disease. Healthcare professionals around the world are researching various treatments for COVID-19, including drugs that already exist to treat other conditions to see if they may be effective against COVID-19 as well.\n\nNo treatments are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for COVID-19, but because COVID-19 is a public health crisis, doctors can treat patients using some drugs that are not technically approved for COVID-19. Emergency use authorization enables unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used for diagnosis, treatment or prevention in an emergency setting, even if the treatments may still be under further study.\n\nRemdesivir, an antiviral drug manufactured by Gilead Sciences that stops the virus from replicating, received emergency use authorization by the U.S. FDA. It reportedly reduced the recovery time for hospitalized patients from 15 days to 11 days, and early results indicate that it may reduce mortality among patients who are very sick from COVID-19. \n\nIn terms of clinical management of symptoms, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 treatment guidelines indicate that Remdesivir supplies are limited and should be prioritized for patients who need it most (hospitalized patients who require supplemental oxygen). The guidelines also recommend the use of dexamethasone, a steroid that can reduce inflammation, for patients who require ventilators or supplemental oxygen. Healthcare professionals use ventilators and supplemental oxygen to ensure that hospitalized patients have a healthy supply of oxygen in the body, and monitor patients accordingly. At present, there is no other cure for COVID-19.\n",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "India"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Ayurveda is one of the world's oldest systems of traditional medicine. Since there is no approved treatment for COVID-19 yet, many people are turning to alternative or traditional medicine for answers. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of a major manufacturer of herbal products, Patanjali,  has claimed that the company has found an Ayurvedic cure for COVID-19. Patanjali claims that COVID-19 patients showed a 100% recovery rate when administered the Ayurvedic medicine known as 'Coronil,' which is comprised of a mixture of Tulsi, Giloy, and Ashwagandha. It is unclear whether this was a randomized controlled trial, and the company has claimed it conducted a clinical case study with \"hundreds of positive patients,\" which showed \"100 percent favorable results.\" The clinical trials were claimed to have been conducted in two cities in India after securing regulatory approval last week. According to the press release, COVID-19 patients who were administered Ayurvedic medicine recovered in 2-14 days and tested negative for the virus, but no data has been released to the public yet.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Ayurveda is ancient Indian medical system that focuses on natural, holistic approaches to physical and mental health. Currently, there is no evidence to indicate that Ayurvedic medicine cures or prevents COVID-19. Similar claims for Ayurvedic cures have been made in the past for other infectious diseases with no known cure, such as HIV/AIDS, without any reliable evidence. Such bold claims should always be treated with caution. \nIn this particular case, the CEO of a major manufacturer of herbal products has claimed to have produced an Ayurvedic cure without providing any independent data to support these claims. While the company claims to have tested hundreds of patients in a \"clinical case study\" which showed a 100% recovery rate, it is unclear whether any control group was included or whether the design of the study was strong enough to substantiate such claims. In addition, the company stated that all patients tested negative for the virus within 5-14 days after receiving the Ayurvedic medicine, but it is unclear how long each patient had the virus or were symptomatic. \nThe study also falsely claimed that Ayurvedic medicine is a cure for COVID-19 without disclosing how many patients were included in their research and how they can be sure that patients would not have tested negative naturally once the immune system fought off the infection over time. Ayurvedic medicine may be a helpful complement to Western medicine, and may not actively cause harm in some cases, but it should not be consumed as a cure for COVID-19. Instead, traditional prevention measures such as wearing masks and social distancing, should be followed to prevent infections.\n",

    "Background & context": "Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Therefore, cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in households and community settings. In this context, disinfecting can be used to disinfect frequently touched surfaces (for example: tables, doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, toilets, faucets, sinks, and electronics). Disinfecting wipes are usually are wet wipes commercially available and containing chemicals, for example, EPA-registered disinfectants, or alcohol-based wipes (minimum 70% of alcohol) to kill germs on surfaces. However, transmission of COVID-19 occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through touching objects and surfaces, like doorknobs, countertops, keyboards, toys, etc. \n\n",
    "What our experts say": "Disinfectant wipes should never be reused. Reusing wipes will move germs from one surface to another, which is potentially harmful in the current pandemic. In order for any surface to be properly disinfected, the U.S. CDC recommends following the instructions on each product carefully and leaving the disinfectant on the surface for 3-5 minutes. This means the surface needs to be wet for this period of time, and you may need to use more than one disinfectant wipe depending on the size of the surface. However, you should never reuse the same disinfectant wipe.\n",

    "Question": "How can I protect myself if I am attending a protest or mass gathering?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & protests",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Protests and mass gatherings take place outdoors, which means in principle that the outdoor air can dilute the virus and reduce the risk of inhaling the virus with each breath. However, in practice, attending protests and mass gatherings still carry a significant risk of COVID-19 transmission. This is because when attending a protest it can be hard to practice social distancing (being 6 feet apart from one another) and that people can be speaking and shouting while standing close to one another, increasing the risk of transmission. In addition, tear gas and pepper spray are often used in protests to break up crowds. These can cause people to tear up and remove their masks to cough a lot, because of trouble breathing. These actions both increase respiratory secretions from the eyes, nose and mouth, further increasing the risk of COVID-19 transmission.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Attending protests or mass gatherings can increase the risk of catching COVID-19 or spreading the disease. This is especially so given the large amount of people who are infected with COVID-19 but do not have any symptoms (pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic), and may feel well enough to attend a mass gathering like a protest or march. In this context, there are a few steps you can take to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. These include first of all wearing a mask and trying to maintain a certain distance from other people at the protest - 6 feet (or 2 m) where possible. Additionally, wearing heat resistant gloves and eye protection (ex: sunglasses) is also recommended. Since yelling - even through a mask - can increase the spread of respiratory droplets due to the force that pushes them out, it is recommended to choose signs or drums (or similar noise makers) if you want to express a message. To prevent further spread of the virus, it is recommended to stick to a 'buddy group' when participating in protests to keep the number of close contacts low. In the event one person in the group is found to be infected with COVID-19, it will be easier to contact all the people who came into close contact with that person and take the recommended public health measures. Similarly, it is recommended for protesters to get tested if possible after taking part in protests. In the US, some states are offering free testing for protesters. Finally, make sure to carry hand sanitizer to disinfect your hands as much as needed and carry water to keep hydrated.\n\n\n",

    "Question": "Can cannabis prevent, treat or cure COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Treatment, Cure, Prevention",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & cannabis",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "Canada"
    ],
    "Background & context": "In recent years, there has been a significant interest in the development of therapies and other consumer products derived from cannabis and its components, including cannabidiol (CBD).Â The U.S. FDA has approved only one CBD product, a prescription drug product to treat two rare, severe forms of epilepsy. In the context of COVID-19, media reported the results of a preprint study indicating the possibility that cannabis could prevent COVID-19 by blocking the virus' entry into the lungs. This study has not gone through the peer review process, has not been assessed by peers, and has not published in any scientific journal. \n",
    "What our experts say": "There is no reliable evidence so far to suggest that cannabis can prevent, treat or cure COVID-19. One pre-print (a type of study that is yet to be peer-reviewed) from Canada suggests possible anti-inflammatory properties in cannabis may be effective in future treatments of the disease. The study also suggests that cannabis could be used to prevent infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into cells in the human body by interacting with the ACE2 receptor protein, which is found on the surface of many cells. This study suggests that cannabidiol (CBD), one of the active ingredients in cannabis, may affect the virus' ability to bind to the ACE2 receptor protein and enter cells. However, none of the claims in the pre-print study have been validated in large-scale studies, and pre-print data should always be treated with caution. \n\nAnother lab, in Israel, is studying the effects of cannabis on the immune system's response to COVID-19 and analyzing the potential for molecules in cannabis to prevent the virus from entering cells and spreading. This research, however, has been undertaken by a cannabis research and development company based in Israel, and not independently verified by other scientific studies that are not linked to the cannabis industry. At this point, there is insufficient independent research to make any claims about the use of cannabis in preventing, treating, or curing COVID-19.\n",

    ],
    "Background & context": "Hydroxycloroquine is a medication currently prescribed for preventing or treating malaria, an infectious disease that can be transmitted to humans from mosquitos. It is also prescribed as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, which are both autoimmune diseases.\nWhen faced with an unknown virus like COVID-19 and without a specific vaccine and treatment, one of the best medical strategies is to look among the medications already available and clinically tested to see if any of them are effective. As their risks, benefits, and side effects have already been studied (without allowing safety tests to be ignored), this could speed up research. One of these is hydroxychloroquine.Â \nWhen trying to find treatments for COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine was tested on hospitalized patients. However, the results from this research do not represent evidence significant enough to recommend hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19. At the same time, some research studies have also shown some serious negative consequences (incl. serious heart rhythm problems)Â associated with the use of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19. More studies are underway.\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "Ongoing clinical trials are testing how safe and effective chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are as treatments for COVID-19. So far, clinical trials and scientific analyses have not produced high quality evidence showing efficacy of these medications as a treatment, and some studies have even reported higher rates of adverse events (including cardiac issues) in hospitalized patients treated with hydroxychloroquine. As things stand, hydroxychloroquine is not a recognized prevention, treatment or cure for COVID-19.\nIn this context, there are research studies underway to find out whether taking this medication can prevent people from getting infected with coronavirus once they have been exposed. Other studies are still investigating the efficacy and safety of the drug as a treatment at different stages of the illness, including randomized controlled trials with a large number of patients enrolled.\nAround the world, some countries have moved ahead and authorized chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 despite limited clinical evidence supporting its efficacy. This decision follows some preliminary results coming out of China and France in March 2020, where a few small clinical trials showed limited success of the medication.\nIn the Unites States, on March 27th 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted a special permission (Emergency Authorization Use) to use chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in emergency situations for treatment of COVID-19. This did not constitute a formal approval of the drug, but rather a possibility given to American doctors to use chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 if the doctor has no other options and after discussing with the patients the risks involved. On June 15th 2020, the U.S. FDA has revoked the special permission to use chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in emergency situations for COVID-19 citing that these drugs are unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 and highlighting serious cardiac adverse events and other serious side effects reported in studies.\n",

    "Question": "Can someone get reinfected and get COVID-19 a second time?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background & context": "As scientists, public health professionals, and doctors monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, they continue to learn about how the virus spreads, its symptoms, and other factors important to diagnosis, testing, monitoring, and long-term public health planning. The possibility of reinfection continues to be a prominent news headline with healthcare professionals reporting that some patients who had fully recovered from the virus later redeveloped symptoms. Some case reports detail how both symptom monitoring and testing have been performed, and, in some instances, patients have documented recovery of COVID-19 with negative virus test results only to become ill and test positive weeks or months later.Â \n\nWhile there are still many aspects of the virus and the pandemic that are unknown, recent research suggests that reinfection may be possible. Newer research shared with a preprint release on July 11th, 2020 found that COVID-19 antibodies function similarly to those from other coronaviruses that are associated with common colds. While the number of antibodies is higher in patients with more severe illness, reports suggest that the protective antibodies decrease relatively quickly (sometimes within 60 days)- especially in patients who had a mild case of COVID-19. Similarly, a population-based study from Spain examined antibodies of more than 50,000 people with possible exposure early in the pandemic and found that very few people have maintained antibodies to date- even those who lived in areas significantly impacted by the virus. Finally, a study done in primates (not humans) showed that COVID-19 immunity was maintained for 28 days following the original infection, but the study did not include longer range measures and, as an animal study, may not be directly comparable to humans.\n\nIt is important to note that, unlike other viruses, the number of antibodies needed to prevent reinfection with COVID-19 is unknown as is the level of antibodies needed to suggest that someone is âimmuneâ to the virus. Studies to further understand immunity as well as the possibility for reinfection are ongoing.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Scientists do not know for sure if people can become infected with COVID-19 a second time, but it may be possible. More evidence is needed to determine whether or not reinfection can occur. We are still learning a lot about what kind of natural defense - also known as immunity - a person has after being infected with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Currently, there haven't been any documented cases of re-infection in scientific journals. In some cases, some patients have tested positive a second time for the virus but scientists think that this is most likely residual viral RNA (traces of the virus left in the body) that is being detected by very sensitive tests or through false-positive tests. As we learn more about long-term immunity and protection from re-infection, this could change, but currently we haven't seen published cases to support that it is occurring. For those concerned about antibody tests - tests used to determine whether or not a person was infected with COVID-19 in the past - it is important to note that a lack of antibodies several months after infection might not mean the person has no immunity against the virus and is susceptible to infection again. \n",

    "Question": "What do we know about the association between blood type and severe reaction to COVID-19",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background & context": "The media is now reporting on how more recent studies found that blood type is not linked to risks of intubation or death from COVID-19, after adjusting for other factors like age and gender identity. Furthermore, it is important to note that Type O blood does not mean immunity to COVID-19.\n---\nUPDATED: July 27, 2020: Please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, where scientists are continuing to learn more and release new publications. The latest and most accurate answer can be found above.\n\nAs part of the ongoing search for explanations about why the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 impacts people differently, ranging from no symptoms to death, recent research and news articles have reported on potential associations between patient blood type and COVID-19 disease severity. Blood types are determined by the presence or absence of certain antigens in the blood, which are molecules that help your immune system use to detect a foreign threat or invader. Everyone has a blood type - A, B, AB, or O - so these recent findings have the potential to impact many people.\n\nResearch into how Type A blood could be associated with more severe COVID-19 symptoms helps inform the work of medical professionals. The hope is that evolving scientific knowledge will help medical professionals better determine which patients are at higher risk and may need additional care.\n",
    "What our experts say": "As of now, there is not enough evidence to indicate whether or not there may be some connection between blood type and COVID-19 risk, though the link is likely to be minimal if it does exist. Studies previously cited in the news suggested that Type A blood could be associated with higher risks of severe cases of COVID-19, included studies that had not yet been assessed by scientific experts (referred to in science as the peer-review process). One of these recent studies had been peer-reviewed and published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM); however it used genes to determine the blood type, which is a method that is not very accurate.  \n\nTwo more recent studies from Columbia University and Massachusetts General Hospital in the U.S. found that blood type is not associated with risks of intubation or death from COVID-19, after adjusting for other factors. While scientists continue to learn more, age and underlying health conditions remain more significant risk factors for severe COVID-19 symptoms, and Type A blood is not thought to be a major risk factor at this time. \n\nWhile some studies have suggested a potential risk reduction for people with Type O blood, not all the studies have been peer-reviewed and the use of blood donors as study participants can give the appearance of Type O being more protective than it is (Type O blood is over-represented in blood donors, compared to the general population). Type O blood does not mean immunity to COVID-19.\n---\nUPDATED: July 27, 2020: Please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, where scientists are continuing to learn more and release new publications. The latest and most accurate answer can be found above.\n\nEuropean scientists have recently found a strong link between different types of the gene that determines our blood type and COVID-19. This genetic variation - having type A blood - was associated with an increased risk of respiratory distress in patients with Covid-19; meaning these patients would be more likely to require oxygen or go on a ventilator. Scientists are actively trying to understand why patients with Type A blood seem to be at higher risk of developing serious cases of COVID-19 and more studies are underway to confirm these findings and explain the underlying mechanism. Genetic studies like these raise the possibility that administering DNA tests to patients who test positive for COVID-19 could perhaps help identify patients who will need advanced care. \n\nResearchers have been looking for clues that would explain why some individuals become ill with COVID-19 whereas others do not, even though they test positive for the virus. These teams are also working to discover why some patients become more ill than others when they become infected with COVID-19. One such area of research is our DNA - the long molecule in the nucleus of our cells that contains our unique genetic code.\n\n\n",

    "Question": "Can convalescent plasma help treat COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background & context": "Using convalescent plasma from individuals who were previously infected to treat sick individuals has been in practice for nearly 100 years for several diseases including polio, influenza, and Ebola. Plasma is the liquid portion of the blood and contains disease-specific antibodies that helped fight the infection in a recovered individual, and that may help fight the infection in a newly infected recipient. As a result, convalescent plasma is being explored as an option for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.\n\nIn March 2020, the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) announced an emergency investigational process to allow doctors to treat serious cases with convalescent plasma. In April 2020, the FDA announced a National Expanded Access Protocol through the Mayo Clinic that expanded convalescent plasma treatment to include adults at risk of severe disease in addition to adults with severe cases. Additionally, a number of clinical trials are underway to study the efficacy of convalescent plasma in preventing or treating COVID-19 in a range of cases.Â \n\nMore research is still necessary to determine if convalescent plasma is effective and safe as a treatment for COVID-19. Scientists are working to identify whether it might help reduce severity of illness, shorten the duration of illness, or even prevent death associated with COVID-19.\n",
    "What our experts say": "When someone has been infected with COVID-19, their body's immune system produces substances called antibodies that work to destroy the virus. These antibodies can usually be found in the blood of people after they recover from the virus, specifically in the liquid portion of the blood called 'plasma.' Because the antibodies in plasma helped the infected person fight off the virus and improve their health, researchers are studying whether or not transferring plasma from patients who have recovered or are almost fully recovered (also called 'convalescent') to patients currently infected with the virus can help their immune systems fight off the infection as well. This experimental use of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 is not an approved treatment by the World Health Organization or the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but there is some indication that it might be beneficial in the early stages of a COVID-19 infection. More research needs to be conducted before scientists reach a consensus about any benefits or negative impacts plasma may have in infected patients.\n",

    "Question": "What are medical reasons people can't wear masks? ",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Masks are a type of personal protective equipment (PPE), along with face shields, protective eye goggles, gloves, gowns, and other equipment. Proper use of PPE can help reduce the spread of COVID-19. Wearing PPE is a risk reduction measure that lowers the chances of getting infected or infecting someone else, but does not eliminate the risk completely. Hand washing and physical distancing (min of 6 feet / 2 metres) are still recommended. \n\nIn the U.S., the government recently warned that they did not issue or endorse fraudulent flyers being circulated about mask use under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). People are encouraged to follow official ADA guidance, which is available at http://ADA.gov, +1-800-514-0301 (voice), and +1-800-514-0383 (TTY). While the U.S. does not currently have a national level policy around the use of masks, an increasing number of cities, counties, and states have passed policies known as \"mask mandates\" that require people to wear masks in certain public settings. Medical exemptions for wearing masks under these policies can be checked with the responsible government offices.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Wearing masks or other face coverings can help slow the spread of COVID-19. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) recommends wearing masks, except for children under 2 years old, and anyone who has trouble breathing, anyone who is unconscious or incapacitated, and anyone who is unable to remove a mask without help. \n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), which enforces the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), there is no \"blanket exemption to people with disabilities from complying with legitimate safety requirements necessary for safe operations,â including mask policies set by businesses and local governments. The ADA does require that people with disabilities are âreasonably accommodated,âÂ such as by finding alternative public health measures for people who cannot safely wear and breathe through a mask.\n",

    "Background & context": "Masks are a type of personal protective equipment (PPE), along with face shields, protective eye goggles, gloves, gowns, and other equipment. Proper use of PPE can help reduce the spread of COVID-19. Wearing PPE is a risk reduction measure, not a risk avoidance measure, so masks can help lower (but not completely eliminate) the chances of getting infected or infecting someone else. Maintaining hygiene, physical distancing, and other measures are still recommended.\n",
    "What our experts say": "In combination with hand washing and social distancing measures, it is important to wear masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19 because the virus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets released when people speak, cough, sneeze or sing. Some infected people may not appear ill or may develop symptoms at a later time, but they can still spread the virus without symptoms. Masks prevent people from spreading the virus to others, especially when we can't be 6 ft / 2m apart. Cloth masks primarily protect people in close proximity to the person wearing the mask by trapping droplets that are released from the wearer. Cloth masks can also protect the wearer by filtering out some virus particles trying to enter. \nMedical masks (N95 or FFP2) filter virus particles from entering more effectively than cloth masks and are designed to protect the wearer. Supplies of those are limited and generally reserved for doctors.\n",

    "Question": "What do we know so far about COVID-19 and nursing homes?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Transmission",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & nursing homes",
    "Background & context": "Since the earliest outbreaks in the United States occurred in nursing care homes for the elderly, much speculation has surrounded older populations as they are high-risk for the virus. In addition, nursing home residents remain in enclosed spaces, are sometimes in close confines with others, and often have preexisting conditions, so their risk increases. \n\nIn response to this, most countries with large populations of people over 65 have created new regulations to make sure that patient, employee, and healthcare worker safety in these facilities is the highest priority. By using these new standards, the risks should be significantly reduced for residents and employees alike.\n",
    "What our experts say": "The risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is particularly high in nursing homes, which cater to vulnerable older adults who often have chronic illnesses or underlying conditions. A nursing home in Kirkland, Washington was one of the first hotspots for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States: the facility accounted for 30 out of the 46 deaths in Washington due to COVID-19 at the time. Since then, there have been several outbreaks in nursing homes across the United States, including in Montana and Utah, as of July 2020. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control also found that long-term nursing care facilities were vulnerable to outbreaks long before the COVID-19 pandemic: 80% of the 2,590 non-foodborne outbreaks of norovirus in the US from 2009 to 2012 were attributed to long-term care facilities.\n\nNursing home residents are vulnerable to severe complications and mortality from COVID-19, and residents often live close to one another, which makes it challenging to implement quarantine and social distancing measures. Close proximity to caregivers who assist multiple residents across different rooms in the facility can also contribute to transmission of the virus, especially if infection prevention control measures are inadequate. Many staff lack access to paid sick leave, which may incentivize them to work even while experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. \n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)  recommends encouraging long-term care facility or nursing home workers to stay home if they are sick, screen workers and residents regularly for symptoms of COVID-19, adhere to U.S. CDC visitation guidelines, maintain at least 6 feet / 2m between workers, visitors, and residents, stagger breaks to prevent overcrowding, and provide hand washing facilities and alcohol-based hand sanitizer throughout the nursing home, among other measures. The U.S. CDC further recommends improvements in reporting COVID-19 cases from nursing home facilities, assigning at least one individual trained in infection and prevention control (IPC) to manage IPC on-site, screen visitors upon entry, and limit visitors (especially if they are experiencing symptoms), and create a robust testing plan for all employees and residents of the nursing home. There should also be guidelines in place to dedicate a separate unit of the nursing home to care for known or suspected COVID-19 patients to prevent further transmission. Visitation requirements can be tightened or relaxed depending on the number of cases in the community: the U.S. CDC recommends use of alternative methods such as video conferencing in lieu of in-person visits. Preventive measures include restricting all visitors except for compassionate care reasons, such as end-of-life care.\n",

    "Question": "What do we know so far about \"COVID toes\"?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Fact-checking organization"
    ],
    "Background & context": "There have been many reports of new and emerging symptoms linked to COVID-19 throughout the evolution of the pandemic.Â As healthcare professionals continue to learn about the virus and its presentation, classifying symptoms according to their severity and frequency has become important in making accurate and timely diagnoses. While the most common symptoms of COVID-19 are breathing problems, fever, coughing, and fatigue, other symptoms of infection have also been identified and include nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, sore throat, loss (or absence) of smell or taste, and muscle aches.Â \n\nAnother symptom that has been occasionally reported is a discoloration (a slightly purple or pink color) or bumpy rash on the toes, feet, or hands- commonly referred to as âCOVID toes.â Reports have continued to suggest that âCOVID toesâ are fairly uncommon, though they may occur more often in younger, asymptomatic patients. Healthcare professionals often suggest that patients contact their doctors for any unusual symptoms that they experience, and patients should seek medical care and coronavirus testing if they experience symptoms common to coronavirus infection.\n",
    "What our experts say": "\"COVID toes\" typically refers to purple or pink discoloration, often with small, raised bumps on the skin on the tips of the toes and, in some instances, on the hands. Current research on the symptom is still evolving, and the exact cause of the symptom remains unclear. It is also important to note that multiple of the reports published about \"COVID toes\" are not based on patients having positive laboratory test results for COVID-19. The association with COVID-19 in these reports is based on the patients self-reporting COVID-19 symptoms or reporting having been in close proximity with someone diagnosed with COVID-19.\nThe appearance of \"COVID toes\" and other symptoms can vary from patient to patient, and a dermatologist or clinician should be consulted for better clarity and safety in diagnosis. As of now, it is not clear what makes some people infected with COVID-19 have this reaction to the virus. It is not clear when in the course of illness the discoloration and rashes are most likely to be observed, and some reports suggest that these symptoms may occur more commonly in people without other typical symptoms of COVID-19.\n",

    "Question": "Are there any side effects of using hand sanitizer?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background & context": "The virus causing COVID-19 can spread from touching an infected surface, from exposure to respiratory droplets, and from airborne transmission. Person-to-person spread (i.e. not from touching surfaces) is the most well understood form of transmission, as well as the main transmission route for COVID-19. Hand sanitizer is one way to clean your hands after touching surfaces and/or interacting with people, particularly when hand-washing is not an option. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) recommends soap and water for hand hygiene whenever possible and especially during cooking, after using the restroom, before eating, and when hands are visibly soiled. When using hand sanitizer, it is important to rub it over the entire surface of hands until dry.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Side-effects of hand sanitizer are short-term and often mild. The side effects are usually related to skin irritation, like cracking and bleeding, due to either irritation from the product or overuse and drying of the skin. It is important to always check the label to ensure safe use. Ingestion or use around the eyes and nose can cause irritation. \n\nAlcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol to be effective. Hand sanitizer is a good way to clean hands when soap and water isn't available and is effective against the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\n\nUPDATED: July 24, 2020: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently issued a warning on the increase in hand sanitizer products containing methanol, instead of ethanol. Methanol, or wood alcohol, is a toxic substance when absorbed through the skin or when ingested that can lead to blindness, hospitalizations, or death. At least 75 brands of hand sanitizer have been recalled for safety reasons, and the FDA also warns against false labels claiming a hand sanitizer product is \"FDA-approved\" (because the FDA has not and does not approve any hand sanitizer products). Hand sanitizer products should be stored out of the reach of children to help prevent accidental ingestion. If you become exposed to hand sanitizer containing methanol and are experiencing symptoms, seek immediate treatment for potential reversal of methanol poisoning.Â \n",

    "Question": "What do we know about pregnant women and COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background & context": "While pregnant women might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease, there is no data yet to show any pre-term complications. Since it is possible for pregnant women to transmit the virus to a newborn, it is common to test pregnant women pre-labor for the novel coronavirus. It is unknown if the virus is spread before, during, or after birth. \n\nThere have been documented cases of mistreatment, abuse, and obstetric violence of pregnant women globally in the context of COVID-19. Examples include limited prenatal care, lack of choice around who is in the delivery room, separation from newborns, and verbal abuse. The World Health Organization has issued guidance on pregnancy and COVID-19 aiming to address these concerns by discouraging negative actions such as newborn separation and forced cesarean sections.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Currently, pregnant women are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease, meaning that there is a higher chance they will require hospitalization and have more serious symptoms of the disease if they become infected. Preterm and other birth-related complications have not been associated with COVID-19 at this time. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) encourages pregnant women to take preventive measures and continue to seek prenatal care. If infected and contagious during labor, it is possible for the mother to spread the disease to the newborn. \n",

    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "Philippines"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Health practitioners, scientists, and journalists have reported major differences in COVID-19 symptoms from patient to patient. This includes differences in the severity of symptoms, in the duration of symptoms, and in the organs affected. For example, some patients have reported lingering impacts of COVID-19 that lasted months, and the long-term effects of the disease are not fully known yet. Recently, more news has been circulating about COVID-19 and its impact on the brain following the publication of a study on British patients who experienced symptoms ranging from brain inflammation and delirium to nerve damage and stroke.\n",
    "What our experts say": "As COVID-19 is a new illness, we don't know all of its short- and long-term impacts yet. Most people (80%) infected with COVID-19 have mild or no symptoms. Some of the short-term impacts for people with mild symptoms include shortness of breath in the lungs and airways, fever, cough, and body aches. For more severe cases, the short-term impacts can be varied and affect several organs. These include pulmonary embolisms (lungs), strokes (brain), and kidney damage due to a lack of oxygen or blood clots. The more severe the case and symptoms of COVID-19 in a person, the more likely major organs are negatively impacted by it.\n\nThe long-term effects of COVID-19 are being studied now. However, exhaustion, anxiety, headaches, and muscle aches have been reported most often in patients reporting symptoms many weeks after the beginning of their infection with COVID-19. As it has only been six months since the discovery of the virus, the real long-term impacts remain unknown. For some people infected with the virus, their symptoms have lasted longer than 100 days. Recent studies that have documented long term symptoms include lung scarring; heart damage; neurocognitive impacts like dizziness, loss of taste and smell, and headaches;Â renal failure; limited lung capacity and difficulty breathing among many others. One notable aspect of the long-term impacts is that they also effect people who had mild cases, not just those who were hospitalized or had severe symptoms for weeks. Though most people recover from the virus within a few weeks, the long-term effects of the virus could impact many organs in different ways.\n\n\n",

    "Question": "What do we know about the Moderna vaccine so far?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background & context": "Over 165 vaccines against the coronavirus are in development around the world, and approximately 25 are in human trials. Moderna was the first American company to test a vaccine in humans. The genetic vaccine, which uses genetic material from the virus (called mRNA) to prompt the immune system to fight the virus, was developed by researchers at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Because this vaccine was the first to be tried in humans as part of a clinical trial, it has been widely discussed and followed, and has gained more media attention recently due to Moderna publishing promising Phase 1 results on July 14, and announcing that they are moving into a Phase 3 trial starting July 27. A phase 2 trial in 600 healthy adults is ongoing.Â Moderna hopes to have the vaccine ready by early 2021.\n\nThe results from the Moderna Phase 1 trial show that those who received the vaccine produced more antibodies that neutralized the virus **-- **meaning the antibodies successfully defended cells from the virus by blocking any effect the virus has biologically**.** These results have prompted wider discussion of a few open questions regarding the success of this vaccine and the others in development: 1) Can the production of antibodies predict protection against an infection? 2) Can antibodies predict protection against the level of infection, and 3) Will the antibodies produced last for a long time? and if yes, for how long? Research is ongoing to answer these questions.Â \n",
    "What our experts say": "Following encouraging results of phase 1 vaccine clinical trials, Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine is expected to start phase 3 trials on July 27, 2020 with 30,000 participants age 18 and older. A phase 2 trial in 600 healthy adults is ongoing.Â There are typically three phases of vaccine clinical trials, where Phase 3 is the last one conducted on a large amount of people. Phase 3 seeks to confirm results obtained in Phase 1 and Phase 2 with respect to safety and efficacy of the vaccine before approving it for manufacturing and distribution. In the upcoming Moderna Phase 3 trial, patients will be randomly assigned to receive two vaccine doses or a placebo.** **A placebo is a harmless, inactive substance that physically looks like the vaccine being tested, so researchers can make a comparison.\n\nModerna published early results in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) on July 14, 2020, based on Phase 1 trials with 45 participants, between age 18 and 55, receiving two vaccine doses each. The participants were split evenly into 3 groups to test different amounts of the vaccine: 25, 100, and 250 micrograms. While no major safety concerns were found that would stop the trials, over half of the participants experienced side effects such asÂ fatigue, chills, headache, muscle aches, and pain at the injection site. The participants receiving the highest vaccine dose (250 micrograms) had more severe side effects. A phase 2 trial is ongoing and is evaluating doses of 50 and 100 micrograms in participants. The next phase (Phase 3) of the clinical trial will focus on studying the middle vaccine amount (100 micrograms).\n\nBy day 43 of the Phase 1 trial, researchers observed immune responses in all participants that could reduce the ability of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to infect people by 80% or more. By day 57, participants who received 100 micrograms of the vaccine had average levels of neutralizing antibodies that were about twice the average levels found in patients who have recovered from COVID-19. Neutralizing antibodies, made from plasma cells (a type of white blood cell), are a subset of antibodies (special proteins that help the body to fight viruses, bacteria, and other threats that can make people sick) that reduce the ability of a virus to infect cells and cause disease. More research is being conducted to ensure the Moderna vaccine is safe for use by diverse populations, and effective in providing long-term immunity that can protect people from getting sick when exposed to the virus.\n\n",

    ],
    "Background & context": "As COVID-19 is a new virus that researchers have been studying for just under six months, we are still learning new information about it every day. This includes how long people might be contagious with the virus, though the evidence we have so far has given us a solid idea of this length of time for the vast majority of patients. There are still some outliers, but most patients fall within these time frames of contagiousness.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Recent research has shown that a person infected with COVID-19 may be able to spread the virus up to 72 hours before they begin having any symptoms up to 10 days after symptoms completely disappear. New studies have suggested that people are the most infectious during the 48 hours before they start to experience any symptoms. People who have tested positive for COVID-19 but never develop any symptoms over the following 10 days from the time they took the test are likely no longer contagious. There are always exceptions to these guidelines, so experts still recommend completing 14 days of isolation after testing positive for the virus, being exposed to a person who has been infected with COVID-19, or developing any symptoms. The best way to ensure you are no long contagious is by having two negative COVID-19 tests 24 hours apart that are both negative.\n",

    "Background & context": "There are a number of different ways that viruses can be transmitted. Some viruses can spread through physical contact or touch, through bodily fluids such as the exchange of saliva, or through the air. Other viruses might be transmitted through bites from ticks or mosquitos, who carry the virus, or through food and water that are contaminated. Some other viruses can be shared through sexual contact, or by sharing needles that have been contaminated by bodily fluids. \n",
    "What our experts say": "There have been no documented cases of sexual transmission. Based on the evidence available right now, experts do not know whether COVID-19 can spread from person to person through bodily fluids that are not respiratory functions like talking, coughing and sneezing. Some confusion around this could be because traces of the virus that causes COVID-19 were found in the semen samples of 6 out of 38 men who provided samples in a research study. According to the study, four of the six men were still infected, while two were recovering. This does not mean that COVID-19 is sexually transmitted. Traces of the virus have also been found in other bodily fluids and stool samples, but it is unclear whether the virus can spread from person to person through sexual transmission.\n",

    "Background & context": "There have been many reports of people experiencing a variety of different symptoms as a result of COVID-19 infection. While some symptoms occur in just a few people, other symptoms are more common or âtypicalâ for many people with COVID-19. Typical symptoms for most people with COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, and tiredness; and less common symptoms include headache, loss of taste or smell, rashes or discoloration on fingers or toes, diarrhea, and others according to the World Health Organization. The medical and scientific communities are continually learning about COVID-19 and its symptoms in people based on age, ethnicity, body composition, pre-existing medical conditions, and other factors. The World Health Organization, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other leading health organizations are continually updating their public information to share what is currently known about the COVID-19 and its impacts.\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "COVID-19 can impact people in different ways, but most people who are infected with the virus will only have mild to moderate symptoms and won't need to be hospitalized. Most cases of the virus are not dangerous, but should be taken seriously. The World Health Organization says the most common symptoms are:\n- fever\n- dry cough\n- tiredness\n\nSymptoms fewer people have include: \n- aches and pains\n- sore throat\n- diarrhea\n- conjunctivitis\n- headache\n- loss of taste or smell\n- a rash on skin, or discoloration of fingers or toes\n\nSymptoms that are serious and mean people should contact a medical professional as soon as possible include:\n- difficulty breathing or shortness of breath\n- chest pain or pressure\n- loss of speech or movement\n\nBecause we are learning more about this virus every day, including new symptoms, it is important to pay attention to what your body is feeling and contact a medical professional if you begin to experience any of the above symptoms or notice any other changes in how you normally feel.\n\nAdditionally, the United States Centers for Disease Control People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported â ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. This list does not include all possible symptoms, but these may appearÂ **2-14 days after exposure**Â **to the virus**:\n- Fever or chills\n- Cough\n- Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n- Fatigue\n- Muscle or body aches\n- Headache\n- New loss of taste or smell\n- Sore throat\n- Congestion or runny nose\n- Nausea or vomiting\n- Diarrhea\n\nAdditionally, the United States Centers for Disease Control urges people to seek emergency medical care if they are experiencing any of these symptoms:\n- Trouble breathing\n- Persistent pain or pressure in the chest\n- New confusion\n- Inability to wake or stay awake\n- Bluish lips or face\n\n",

    "Background & context": "Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause a variety of different illnesses, but primarily upper-respiratory tract illnesses in humans. These illnesses include the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Some viruses can originate in animals and later infect humans, and this can happen in a number of different ways, including: by eating meat or produce that has been contaminated by the virus, through the air or by touching a surface that was touched by an infected animal, through close contact with an infected animal, or through insect bites. Not all viruses transfer from animals to humans in all of these ways, it depends on the virus. The resources section contains more information about this. \n\n",
    "What our experts say": "COVID-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China in late 2019. The virus has since been partially traced back to a large seafood and animal market in the city of Wuhan, after several people who had been to the market became sick with the illness we now know as COVID-19. Scientists were able to use genetic tests to confirm that the virus was first identified in people and environmental samples in the city of Wuhan. Tests on the genetics of viruses, much like genetics in humans, can reveal a lot about their origins. When these genetic tests were done on the COVID-19 virus' genes, it revealed that the virus originated in an infected animal and mutated when that animal transferred the virus to a human, likely in the city of Wuhan. The details about that event, which is called a zoonotic transfer, are still being investigated.\n\nUPDATED: July 16, 2020: The majority of scientific studies now support the idea that the origin of the virus in animals was bats, specifically horseshoe bats, potentially from China or neighboring countries of Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam. Scientists also suggest that the virus may have been passed to humans through an intermediate host before spreading to humans, but are unsure about what animal the host might have been, thoughÂ pangolins and civets have been suggested. A potential combination between bats and pangolins as the viral origin has also been noted. World Health Organization experts will soon travel to China and work with Chinese health officials to identify the source of the virus.\n\n\n",

      "USA",
      "Canada"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Recent news articles and studies have focused on people sunbathing as a way to prevent or treat COVID-19. There has been no evidence that sunbathing is effective at combatting COVID-19. \nUltraviolet or UV rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation, present in sunlight. Sunlight emits three kinds of UV rays: UVA, UVB, and UVC. UVC has the highest energy and is filtered by the atmosphere so it does not reach the Earth's surface.\nHowever, UVC rays can also come from some man-made sources, such as UV sanitizing bulbs, and be used in indoor settings, such as hospitals, to disinfect medical equipment and surfaces. This is because UVC has the most energy of the three, and its energy can destroy the genetic material inside viruses. The genetic material in viruses includes information that can control the reproduction, development or behaviour of the virus. But artificial UVC rays are extremely dangerous and deadly to humans and should not be used outside of professional settings to disinfect surfaces and objects.\nAs for the general sunlight, while the sun can kill germs, disinfecting items through sunlight would not be 100% effective and would take a very long time and most household users would not be able to confirm that their items had been fully disinfected during this process. Studies have shown that there are different lengths of time of sun exposure needed for items to be disinfected depending on size, material, etc. Exposure to sunlight is therefore not a recommended solution for disinfecting routine household items. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Exposing yourself to the sun for any period of time does not prevent anyone from spreading COVID-19 to another person or catching COVID-19 from another person. Long-term exposure to sunlight can be very damaging and increase your risk of skin cancer. As of now, there is no clear benefit of sunbathing for preventing or treating COVID-19. \n\n",

    ],
    "Background & context": "Sterile gloves, when properly worn and properly disposed of, can be a helpful element in protecting against infectious disease. However, if a person is not wearing gloves correctly, not putting them on correctly, or not disposing of them correctly, it defeats the purpose of wearing gloves. It is important to remember that any germs that someone comes into contact with, can be on a person's gloves, and can then be transferred to any other surface that the gloves touch. It also can give people a false sense of security while wearing gloves, and can result in people touching surfaces and items more freely, then touching their faces, which can lead to self-contamination with the virus. Wearing gloves is only an effective protection when the person wearing them follows the right protective methods. If they aren't followed, it can lead to contamination with a virus. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Wearing gloves does not directly protect against spread of the virus. COVID-19 is thought to spread primarily through small drops of moisture (respiratory droplets) that are released when a person infected with COVID-19 coughs, talks, or sneezes. Those drops can then land on the faces of people, surfaces, and items nearby. Wearing new and sterile gloves is not as effective as 20 seconds of hand washing with soap and water, but they can help you avoid touching an infected surface or item with your bare hands. Keep in mind that gloves can only prevent infection if you **don't touch your face** with your gloved hands, and only if **you take off and dispose of the gloves correctly** before washing your hands. \nIt is also important to remember to touch as few surfaces and items as possible if you are wearing gloves in order to avoid contaminating surfaces and spreading COVID-19 to more people. Remember that the best way to prevent spreading or getting infected with COVID-19 is through washing your bare hands for 20 seconds with water and soap, maintaining at least six feet of physical distance between yourself and others, and regularly washing and disinfecting surfaces in your household.\nFor people caring for, or in contact with, people who have been infected with COVID-19, wearing gloves can help make sure the caretaker doesn't touch dangerous substances that come from the sick person's body, like mucus from a sneeze, urine, blood, feces, or other fluids. \n",

    "Background & context": "Antibiotics are antibacterial medications that either slow down or destroy the growth of bacteria. They are used to treat infections that are caused by bacteria. (More information on the differences between viruses and bacteria can be found in the additional resources section.) The COVID-19 disease is caused by an infection with a virus, not a bacteria. COVID-19 is a disease that is a type of coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Because viruses and bacteria are different, the illnesses that they cause cannot be treated by the same type of medication. Antibiotics cannot be used to treat viral infections like COVID-19.  \n",
    "What our experts say": "Antibiotics are not used to treat or cure COVID-19, but they _can_ treat bacterial infections that can happen as a result of complications from the COVID-19 virus. Viruses and bacterial infections cause different types of illnesses, and antibiotics are only effective in treating bacterial infections, not viruses like COVID-19. Antibiotics should not be taken as a way to prevent or treat COVID-19 and they should not be taken unless prescribed by a doctor. Sometimes, antibiotics might be used in patients with COVID-19 but **only** to treat secondary bacterial infections. \n",

    "Background & context": "The BGC vaccine, or the bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine, is a vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) disease. This vaccine is used in many countries that have high rates of tuberculosis in order to prevent the disease from spreading. As public health researchers try and understand the low case numbers and death count in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South-East Asia from COVID-19, hypotheses have emerged about the protective power of the BCG vaccine against the coronavirus because of a correlation between countries where the BCG vaccine is widely used and the low number of COVID-19 cases reported in those countries. Recent studies published on this topic do not support the idea that BCG vaccination in childhood has a protective effect against COVID-19 in adulthood. More studies are underway as it's still not clear yet how the BCG vaccine interacts with the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "Multiple studies are exploring the link between BCG vaccination policies in various countries, and the relatively lower number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in those countries.Â Recent studies published do not support the idea that BCG vaccination in childhood is a cause of protection against COVID-19 in adulthood. The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a note on this topic that stated that in the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19. More studies are underway. \n\nUPDATED: July 11, 2020: A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of SciencesÂ (U.S.) noted that after they accounted for differences in variables like income, age distribution, and access to health services, countries with higher BCG vaccination rates had lower peak mortality rates from COVID-19. However, though there is an association between BCG vaccination and reduced severity of COVID-19 observed in this epidemiological study, it does not mean that there is sufficient enough evidence to consider BCG vaccination a cause of protection from severe COVID-19. There is not enough evidence to support whether or not BCG vaccines can offer protection against severe COVID-19 symptoms and death, and we will continue to update this answer as study results targeting the vaccine  are published.\n",

    ],
    "Background & context": "Respiratory droplets are little beads of liquids that fly out when a person sneezes, coughs, or uses their mouth. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that COVID-19 mainly spreads from person to person through these droplets when people come in close contact with one another. Airborne particles tend to be lighter than respiratory droplets and can stay in the air for longer periods of time, which makes airborne viruses even easier to spread. Some studies have shown that COVID-19 could potentially be spread through the air in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. The evidence on this mode of transmission is still evolving. There is a distinct possibility of COVID-19 spreading through air in enclosed spaces, particularly if there is poor ventilation, but the evidence is still evolving. \n\nAirborne transmission of COVID-19 is trending in the news, in part because 239 scientists signed an open letter on July 6, 2020 urging the WHO to update its COVID-19 guidance in response to growing evidence that airborne transmission is possible, ranging from case reports to epidemiological studies. The WHO has since acknowledged the emerging evidence for airborne transmission in \"crowded, closed, poorly ventilated settings,\" while cautioning that the evidence is preliminary and should be assessed further. If airborne transmission of COVID-19 is significant, this has major implications for containment efforts (ex. masks may be needed indoors and in socially-distant settings, ventilation systems may need to minimize recirculating air and find ways to filter or disinfect contaminated air, etc.).\n",
    "What our experts say": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus that causes COVID-19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets (little spit droplets that fly out when a person sneezes, coughs or talks).** **Respiratory droplets can infect other people who are nearby, or indirectly infect others when they touch a surface contaminated with infected droplets. However, some experts are looking at previous data from China to see whether the virus may spread through the air or through vents via lighter droplets that can remain in the air for longer periods of time (**aerosol/airborne transmission**). While a few lab-based studies have found that the virus can be present in the air for up to three hours, these studies did not assess if the virus is viable to infect anyone else. Thus far, the WHO and U.S. CDC still claim most evidence points to close person-to-person droplet transmission. However, experts warn that there is significant reason to believe airborne transmission is happening. Definitive studies may take a long time to alter the body of evidence in the coming weeks and months, but proactive prevention measures such as universal use of masks could save lives in the meantime.  \n",

    ],
    "Background & context": "To be considered high quality, valid, significant, original, and suitable for publication in a scientific journal, studies must complete a peer-review process. As these published studies could potentially influence clinical practices and public health behaviour, this process acts as a filter to ensure every study meets the strict requirements of each journal, causing many studies not to be accepted or published once they go through peer reviews. Pre-print studies have not yet passed the peer-review process so scientists urge caution not to draw any conclusions from pre-print studies. \nThe peer review and publication processes are time-consuming, frequently involving more than a year between submission and publication. The process is also highly competitive.Â \nPeer-reviewed articles provide a trusted form of scientific communication. Even if you are unfamiliar with the topic or the scientists who authored a particular study, you can trust peer-reviewed work to meet certain standards of scientific quality. Since scientific knowledge is cumulative and builds on itself, this trust is particularly important.\nAfter submission of a pre-print study to a journal, the journal's editors send the article to several other scientists who work in the same field (i.e., the \"peers\" of peer review). Those reviewers provide feedback on the article and tell the editor whether or not they think the study is of high enough quality to be published. The authors may then revise their article and resubmit it for consideration. Only articles that meet good scientific standards (e.g., acknowledge and build upon other work in the field, rely on logical reasoning and well-designed studies, back up claims withÂ evidence, etc.) are accepted for publication.\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "Pre-print studies are studies that have been completed but haven't gone through the peer-review process that most scientific journals require for publishing.\nPre-prints provide new data and information, which is important in a pandemic. However the details in a pre-print study, such as: how the study was designed and conducted, what sample sizes were included, what assumptions were made, and how calculations were done, have not been scrutinized by the journal's reviewers and editors. The process of scrutinizing a pre-print study is what the peer-review process consist of. Most websites that publish pre-print articles suggest that these articles should not be reported in the news as established information or used to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior. \nUntil the studies are scrutinized by reviewers, they should not be assumed to be factually correct or inform any actions.\n",

    "Background & context": "Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses which are not particularly environmentally hardy. This means that the virus causing COVID-19 is susceptible to a wide range of cleaning and disinfection products and in direct sunlight, begins to break down within a few minutes. There has been no detection of COVID-19 in drinking water and per the CDC, water filtration and disinfection methods should remove or inactive any existing viral particles in the water. While COVID-19 is not spread through water, there are other viruses and bacteria that can be spread in pool water, such as norovirus, which means it is important to maintain safe levels of chlorine and water treatment.\n",
    "What our experts say": "The virus that causes COVID-19 is spread through respiratory secretions like a cough or a sneeze. While it can also be transmitted through contaminated surfaces and objects (e.g. contaminated door handle), there has been no evidence that it can be spread through water in pools, hot tubs, spas, or water play areas. Moreover, the virus has not been detected in drinking water. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the biggest concern for COVID-19 transmission around pools is related to crowded areas where social distancing cannot occur and the importance of hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette due to many high-touch surfaces and objects. In relation to pools, exposure prevention is focused more on respiratory droplets from other people visiting the pool rather than the water itself.\n",

    "Question": "What are the three phases of vaccine testing?",

    "Country question was sourced from": [

    "Background & context": "There is growing interest in understanding the process of testing vaccines, to get a sense of how long it may take before there is a widely-available vaccine to address the COVID-19 pandemic. There have been many press releases and articles about vaccines in development and the start of human trials, yet health experts at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) warn that it will take time to screen out ineffective and unsafe vaccines as well as to prepare for vaccine use at scale. People are eager for a vaccine to be ready soon for many reasons, including protection of human life, economic recovery, reducing educational interruptions, and lifting restrictions on activities that people enjoy.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Substantial research needs to be completed by scientists before any potential vaccine undergoes phased testing. Once it gets to that stage, there are three research phases of trials that take place before the vaccine can be deployed for use. During the first stage (Phase I), the new vaccine is provided to small groups of peopleâthe first time the vaccine is tested in humans. The second stage (Phase II) involves testing the vaccine on people who have similar characteristics (such as age and physical health) to the target population, or the group for which the vaccine is intended. The goal of this stage is to identify the most effective dosages and schedule for Phase III trials. The final stage (Phase III) provides the vaccine to thousands of people from the target population to see how safe and effective it is. Once the vaccine clears this last stage, the manufacturer can apply for a license from regulatory authorities (like the FDA) to market for human use.\n\nSometimes medications that have already been approved by the U.S. Food and Drugs Administration in clinical trials will enter into a Phase IV trial. This phase focuses on potential side effects from the vaccine or medication that were not seen in the first three phases. This phase also helps researchers understand how well a vaccine works over a longer time frame and how safe it is, often with thousands of people over several years. Phase IV is also called a 'post-marketing surveillance' trial.\n\n\n",

    "Question": " Can animals with no symptoms spread COVID?",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "With an upward trend in adopting pets from shelters during the pandemic, some people are concerned about the risk of animals spreading COVID-19. Additionally, there have been news reports of animals living in households and zoos testing positive for COVID-19, including tigers, lions, and domesticated cats and dogs. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that while the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 is considered low, current recommendations include isolating pets from any sick people in the household as well as limiting interactions between pets and people outside of the household. Both animals and humans can test positive for COVID-19 without showing symptoms.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Yes, but mostly to other animals of the same species. Currently, there is no evidence that animals are a major cause of spreading COVID-19 and the risk of animals passing COVID-19 to humans is low. \n\nAccording to a recently published study in the New England Journal of Medicine, transmission of the virus has been reported between cats, none of which had symptoms. The study found that three domestic cats infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 were able to transmit the virus to three other cats with no previous infection. None of the cats in the experiment showed any symptoms during the course of infection, but researchers found the continued spreading the virus from their noses for about six days. However, the research is rapidly evolving. This is just the first study to document asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 in cats and as of now, there is no evidence of transmission of COVID-19 from cats to humans. \n\nCats aren't the only animals that have been shown to spread the virus with no symptoms. Based on recent research conducted by the Dutch government, it is believed that minks infected with COVID-19 spread the virus to two human employees at regional farms. The minks were having symptoms of a respiratory illness, while another study about COVID-19 in animals has shown that mink can be infected with the virus without having any symptoms.\nDogs, tigers, lions, and ferrets have also tested positive for COVID-19, but these animals all showed symptoms after testing positive for the virus and likely acquired the virus from humans. \n\n\n",

    "Question": "What does it mean to have a fever?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Fever has emerged as a common symptom of COVID-19 infection. A World Health Organization report from February of 2020 suggested that fever was reported in 87.9% of patients with confirmed COVID-19. Fever is an increase in body temperature that is a common symptom of illness or infection, but there are other possible reasons for fever that include heat exhaustion, some medications or immunizations, certain types of cancers, and some inflammatory conditions (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis).Â Â \n\nWhile the average normal temperature is 98.6Â°F (37Â°C), there is some individual variation where an individualâs normal temperature may be slightly higher or lower even when he or she is healthy. In addition, normal body temperature can vary during the day and is often lower in the morning and higher later in the day. A normal temperature range is generally about 97Â°F (36.1Â°C) to 99Â°F (37.2Â°C).Â Â \n",
    "What our experts say": "Having a fever means that your body temperature has temporarily increased and it is a signal that your body may be fighting off an infection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control define a fever as a measured temperature of at least 100.4Â°F (38Â°C), slightly higher than the average human temperature of 98.6Â°F (37Â°C). Fevers are one of the immune system's first reactions to a pathogen - such as a virus or bacteria entering the body. Fevers can also be caused by environmental factors like heat stroke or biological responses like alcohol withdrawal. Your body senses these potential threats and forces itself to raise its temperature (by creating a fever, through chemicals in your blood called 'pyrogens') to make it difficult for the pathogen to use your body as a host and reproduce viruses or bacteria. \n\nNormal body temperatures change every day and usually vary between 97.6Â°F (36.4Â°C) and 99.6 Â°F (37.5Â°C) with lower body temperatures generally occurring in the morning and higher temperatures occurring at night. For most adults, short-term fevers shouldn't be alarming unless it reaches 103Â°F (39.4Â°C) or higher. For infants younger than 3 months, a rectal temperature of 100.4Â°F (38Â°C) or higher signals a fever and in that case a doctor should be contacted. For infants between 3 - 24 months, a rectal temperature of 102Â°F (38.9Â°C) signals a fever that should also be discussed with a doctor. For other young children, even slight fevers can signal infections, so a doctor should be consulted if a fever appears.\n\n",

    "What our experts say": "People who have been infected with COVID-19 but don't have symptoms are considered \"asymptomatic.\" People infected with COVID-19 whose symptoms have not yet developed are called \"pre-symptomatic.\" Even as people who are asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic don't display symptoms, they are still infected with the virus, and have the potential to shed the virus.

    "Question": "What does it mean if the virus is reactivated?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Background & context": "There are multiple reports of patients around the world who have seemed to recover from coronavirus but later return for care with milder symptoms and test positive again. It is not currently known if cases like these are patients with an infection that was never truly gone, a âreinfectionâ from a new source or exposure, or a virus reactivation that could occur if the virus was âdormantâ in cells or tissues in the body. Some of the suspected cases of reactivation or reinfection have also been suggested to occur as a result of faulty testing resulting in false-positive or false-negative results.Â Â International studies of patients with possible reinfection or reactivation are ongoing.\n",
    "What our experts say": "The reactivation of a virus is rare but can potentially happen when a person who was infected no longer has symptoms and is considered recovered, but might still have very small amounts of the virus in their bodies that are considered \"sleeping\" or dormant. This can also be called the latent phase of a virus where virus particles are no longer made and a person doesn't feel ill any longer. Even though the person who was infected hasn't been shedding the virus or spreading the virus to other people, a number of events can happen (like a sudden onset of stress) that can cause the virus to \"wake up\" or reactivate. This can cause symptoms to return and the person can spread infections to others during this time. This is most commonly seen in viruses like the Herpes Simplex Virus. For COVID-19, there have been no studies published that have determined whether or not this virus can become reactivated or can be considered a \"sleeping virus\" that can reinfect a recovered patient.\n\nThough it is early in the global understanding of the virus, recent small studies have suggested that patients who retest positive are not currently infected with coronavirus.  In these cases, reports suggest that the diagnostic tests have detected noninfectious or dead viruses and reported a positive result.\n",

This can represent a public health risk especially during simultaneous handling of food and money, or when touching money and then touching our face without having washed our hands. \nThe current discussion around money as a potential way of spreading diseases is based on studies that found that several types of bacteria can survive on paper money depending on some factors (type of paper, humidity, etc.). However, no strong evidence exists yet around transmission from contaminated money to our bodies.\nSome news outlets previously reported that the World Health Organization (WHO) claimed you could contract the virus that causes COVID-19 from coins and banknotes (paper money). However, the WHO clarified and said this claim had been misrepresented; the WHO did not issue any kind of warning or statement about COVID-19 transmission through coins and banknotes. Instead, they have emphasized the importance of washing hands with soap, especially before handling or eating food. \n",
    "What our experts say": "The virus that causes COVID-19 can potentially be spread through money. However, it's unlikely to cause the COVID-19 illness in humans. A recent study has shown that the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive on solid surfaces like coins for up to four days and on paper like cash for up to three hours, but the virus was no longer infectious (viable) after that point. There has been no rigorous research to conclude or disprove that COVID-19 can be easily spread through coins and paper money otherwise. Therefore, the risk of catching COVID-19 from the virus sticking to money is very low. \nHowever, it is best practice in general to wash your hands and avoid touching your face after touching money. The virus that causes COVID-19 is primarily spread through person-to-person contact, especially if you are in close contact with another person (within about 6 feet or 2 meters). Since we do not yet fully understand all the ways the virus could spread, it would be a good practice to be vigilant with money just as any other potential contaminated surface, and wash your hands with soap after touching it. \n",

    "Question": "Why has Iceland had fewer deaths of COVID-19 than other countries?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background & context": "Media reports suggest that Iceland successfully âbeatâ coronavirus or âeliminatedâ the case curve that many countries have been taking measures to flatten. Unlike many countries, early planning and preparedness was instituted to ensure that the country was able to track and trace anyone possibly exposed to an infected person. Iceland began preparing for COVID-19 before any cases had been reported in the country. By employing law enforcement officers, nurses, and a criminologist, the team was able to use their skills as detectives to track both people and the virus once the first case was identified. As cases increased, the tracing team also increased and included epidemiologists, physicians, and other health professionals; and the country expanded testing to the highest per-capita rate in the world. Though Iceland did not ever institute a lockdown, individuals who were exposed and infected had to quarantined and some types of business were closed (i.e. night clubs, hair salons).\n",
    "What our experts say": "Iceland, a country with 365,000 people has registered 10 deaths from COVID-19, prompting many analyses and news articles over its success in containing the pandemic. Iceland has a small population spread over a very large geography, with hundreds of miles of the Atlantic Ocean separating it from the rest of the Nordic region. This gives it a natural advantage in fighting an infectious disease like COVID-19 that spreads through people, and whose transmission increases exponentially in high density areas. \nIn addition, Iceland took very rapid decisions to respond to the virus on its territory and prevent infections transmission, as soon as they observed the pandemic unfolding in China and Europe, even before cases were registered in Iceland. Hospitals were testing people arriving from abroad for a month before the first confirmed case in Iceland, and a media campaign urged hand washing and social distancing. The country put early restrictions on nursing homes to protect vulnerable segments of the population, and also closed high schools and universities.Â When cases were declared in Iceland and increasing at a fast rate, Iceland implemented very rigorously the test-trace-isolate strategy of containing infectious diseases. All contacts of confirmed cases were located and ordered to quarantine themselves for 14 days. Their policy of testing and tracking to find and isolate infected people, was comprehensive as it was not limited only to people experiencing symptoms but also to asymptomatic people. Their extensive contact tracing effort relied on teams on a large number of people mobilized, including nurses, police officers and health care professionals. \nIceland was able to test such large numbers of people, thanks to a partnership with a private sector companyÂ named [deCODE Genetics][1], based in Reykjavik, Iceland.\n\n  [1]: https://www.decode.com/\n",

    "Question": "Is favipiravir effective in treating COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Treatment",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 and treatment",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "The context for favipiravir is the same as for avifavir, given that avifavir is a generic form of favipiravir. Favipiravir as a potential COVID-19 treatment has been emerging in visibility given that delivery of the drug to Russian hospitals began in June, following the approval of the Russian Ministry of Health. The approval follows promising but limited studies on favipiravir's accuracy in Russia, carried out in partnership of The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Russiaâs sovereign wealth fund, and the ChemRar Group. Studies on the drug had also been conducted in China -- with seemingly promising results yet severe study limitations -- as well as in the US, Italy, Japan and India. Favipiravir works by selectively inhibiting RNA polymerase, necessary for viral replication, but data on its efficacy for COVID-19 is still inconclusive. 60,000 doses of the drug are set to be administered by the end of the month, according to RDIF. Trends in Russia's COVID-19 data, and in particular, additional evidence, are needed to determine efficacy. Though only approved for influenza treatment in Japan, the drug has also been tested with varying levels of accuracy for treatment of Ebola, Zika, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, and Rift Valley fever, among other diseases. \n",
    "What our experts say": "There is not enough evidence right now to know whether or not favipiravir, also known as Avigan, can help treat COVID-19. Favipiravir is a drug that is used as an influenza medication in Japan and China, and is currently in studies to treat other viral infections, including COVID-19, in many other countries. Early studies involving favipiravir showed promising results in reducing the duration of symptoms of COVID-19 and aiding in the recovery of patients. However, there were shortcomings to these studies as well, like only having a small number of patients involved and the presence of age differences between study groups. Additionally, participants in the study were not randomly assigned to their groups (called randomization) and study subjects and their doctors both knew which treatments they received and didn't receive. This might help explain why there is no consensus as to whether or not favipiravir is an effect treatment for COVID-19 at this time.\n",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Recent studies have demonstrated how COVID-19 disproportionately impacts Black people in cities across the United States. This has caused many journalists to highlight how, while the pandemic is affecting everyone, there are major demographic differences in who is most at-risk, and what resources people have to cope. In response, advocates are calling for COVID-19 response and recovery policies to be tailored accordingly, to make sure different communities have the support they need. Beyond health impacts, Black communities can also face more economic disruptions during the pandemic, impacted by both current and historical racial injustices. The recent wave of protests in solidarity with the Movement for Black Lives is raising awareness about multiple issues affecting Black communities, many of which intersect with the pandemic.\n",
    "What our experts say": "The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black communities in the United States, especially as a result of existing structural and racial disparities in the healthcare system, is well documented. Despite comprising only 22% of New York Cityâs population, Black Americans constituted 28% of fatalities from the virus as of mid-April. In Chicago, Black Americans account for 30% of the population, but suffer 70% of reported COVID-19 fatalities. This is likely due to several factors. Racial disparities in access to healthcare contribute to lower quality care for Black populations. Black Americans are more likely to live in densely populated neighborhoods with limited healthcare access. Density can heighten exposure to the virus. \n\nBlack Americans also face higher rates of pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, which heighten the risk of complications from COVID-19. They are also overrepresented in essential professions that are more likely to face routine interactions with people and a higher exposure level to the virus. Finally, research suggests Black populations face racial bias in the healthcare system and are less likely to have access to timely testing, which may also contribute to a higher rate of mortality from the virus. Such factors have contributed to higher COVID-19 mortality rates among Black populations and reflect the disproportionate and devastating impact of COVID-19 on communities of color.Â \n",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Vitamin D is an essential nutrient, which means your body needs it but cannot make it on its own. This is why people have to get their Vitamin D from foods like salmon or egg yolks, supplements, or from spending short amounts of time in the sun. Vitamin D helps ensure your body's immune system and its cells are working well so they can respond to infections and viruses. In addition to its help in retaining calcium levels in the body and promoting bone health, Vitamin D can also potentially reduce cancer cell growth, help minimize inflammation, and help control infections.Â \n",
    "What our experts say": "It is too early to tell whether or not Vitamin D can help treat COVID-19. As of now, Vitamin D has not been tested for its effectiveness in treating COVID-19 patients, so there is no evidence that it can prevent or treat the virus. A recent study looked at data from 20 European countries and noted that in places where more people had cases of Vitamin D deficiency, they also had higher rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths. While this study suggested a possible relationship between lower levels of Vitamin D and poor COVID-19 health outcomes, there isÂ no evidence that Vitamin D levels actually caused more cases or deaths related to COVID-19. \n\nOther studies have noted potential links between low Vitamin D levels and COVID-19, but no consensus has been reached on what the potential impact of the vitamin is on the virus. Researchers are now working on several studies to determine if Vitamin D can be effective in treating COVID-19.\n",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Viruses reproduce themselves in bodies by injecting their DNA or RNA into cells in the body. The genetic material from that injection becomes a blueprint for how to make more and more of the virus.\nEventually the cells in our bodies recognize the virus, and develop new ways to prevent it from duplicating. So viruses adapt by mutating, which disguises them once again from our immune systems so they can continue to duplicate.\n Mutation for viruses simply means a change or transformation. RNA viruses, like SARS-CoV-2 which causes COVID-19, mutate a lot. It is important to track these mutations to understand the various identities of the virus and map its trends across the world. However, as these changes happen, it's also important to understand what adaptation the virus is taking and what are their consequences on human health. It's important to keep in mind that mutations might not translate to drastic changes in severity of the illness or increase its mortality. Mutations are a natural process for RNA viruses and should not be seen as an indicator for suddenly a newer, deadlier virus. Understanding these viral changes and genomic epidemiology can help us understand outbreaks better. \n",
    "What our experts say": "There is no evidence to support the idea that the virus has lost its potency. This question likely stems from comments made by an Italian doctor claiming that COVID-19 is losing its potency by mutating into a less harmful version of itself. However, this has been refuted by the World Health Organization and other respected health and medical bodies. \n\nViral mutations are a common aspect of a virus' lifespan and do not necessarily mean that they will become more deadly, contagious, or inherently different.  Mutations that might change how the virus is transmitted, or how it infects people, does not mean that the mutated virus will spread more or be more harmful. Nor does it mean it will spread less or be less harmful. So far, researchers have stated that while the virus is mutating (like all viruses do) these changes do not translate to significant adjustments in transmission or harm to patients.\n",

    "Background & context": "Respiratory viruses are primarily spread through infectious respiratory droplets (coughing, sneezing, and sometimes talking). Close contact (within 6 feet/2 meters) for a prolonged period of time (15 minutes or more) without respiratory protection is considered an exposure risk for COVID-19. While we don't know what the number of cases related to large gatherings, like the recent protests, will look like, it is likely that there will be some. Protestors are encouraged to not only utilize infection prevention measures, but also quarantine at home for 14 days after protesting. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Large gatherings of people in close contact for a prolonged period of time does increase risk for transmission of respiratory viruses. Outdoor protests allow for natural ventilation, and the additional use of masks, eye protection, and social distancing efforts can help reduce risk. While it is unknown if protests will lead to a large increase in the number of cases, it is possible there will be additional cases in the 2 weeks following protests. \n",

    "Question": "What do people mean when they refer to COVID-19 as being a blood vessel disease?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Symptoms",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "There have been reports of COVID-19 patients experiencing disease symptoms that impact the blood vessels and vascular system, such as blood clots and damage to the endothelial lining of blood vessels. The existence of vascular COVID-19 symptoms is particularly relevant to patients with certain pre-existing conditions (like hypertension or cardiovascular disease), where infection can mean increased risks of severe illness, serious complications, or death. It is important to note that COVID-19 symptoms can vary widely from person to person, with many experiencing primarily respiratory symptoms, other types of symptoms, multiple types of symptoms at once, or no symptoms at all.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Patients who have been infected with COVID-19 can sometimes develop severe symptoms. Some of these symptoms include things like blood clots, heart problems, and \"COVID toes\". One thing all of these issues have in common is their link to blood vessels, the tubes that deliver blood and oxygen throughout the body. When these tubes and the cells that line the insides of the tubes have challenges carrying and spreading blood to organs and tissues, issues like blood clots can occur in many patients.\n\nThough COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness, some researchers believe that the virus may be able to move from the lungs into the blood vessels, often causing additional symptoms such as the ones mentioned above. While some patients have been impacted by blood vessel-related symptoms, COVID-19 is still primarily considered a respiratory illness for most patients.\n\n \n\n",

    "Question": "Can tear gas help spread COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Transmission",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & tear gas",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Tear gas refers to a group of chemical irritants that are designed to irritate mucous membranes, and cause people to tear, cough, and sneeze. It is used as a method of crowd dispersal during protests. During the recent protests in the United States in the wake of George Floyd's death, police departments across the country used tear gas widely in an effort to disperse crowds. This was widely criticized as a counter-productive and dangerous means of crowd dispersal during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "Tear gas and other chemical irritants can cause people to cough, sneeze, and take off their face masks, which can increase the spread of COVID-19. This is the case both for people who have symptoms of the virus and those who might not have any symptoms and don't know they are sick. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads primarily through droplets that are emitted when people exhale, cough, or spit. Tear gas can cause people to cough or scream loudly, which could carry the virus particles much farther than 6 feet (2m) and infect others around them. In addition to inducing coughing, tear gas has also been linked to increased susceptibility to infection in the respiratory tract as well as increased pain and inflammation. A 2014 study found that exposure to tear gas contributed to a significantly higher risk of acute respiratory illnesses (sudden and serious respiratory illnesses). More than 1200 infectious disease and public health professionals have signed a petition opposing the use of tear gas and other respiratory irritants during this pandemic.\n",

    "Source of the question": [

      "India"
    ],
    "Background & context": "India's stringent lockdown measures helped to control the spread of COVID-19 and significantly reduced the rate at which infections doubled by more than half from 4 days to 10 days. However, lockdown measures were lifted right as the country reported a significant surge of cases, particularly populous cities like Delhi and Mumbai, and states like Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Public health experts indicate that lockdown measures in India ended too quickly, just as cases started spiking. The initial lockdown was in effect for 21 days from March 24, 2020, and was extended to May 31, 2020. Following May 31, 2020, the country opened up in phases, and only a few areas continued to place restrictions on movement. Crowded means of transportation, densely packed neighborhoods, and inadequate social distancing have contributed to a steep rise in infections, made worse by a premature end to the lockdown. The end of the lockdown has also sparked a mass exodus of migrant laborers back to their home states, which local health authorities worry has driven the rise in new cases. It's too soon to tell whether the spike in new cases has actually been driven by migrant laborersâincreased testing availability has allowed for more cases to be detected, which may also contribute to the increased case count. Experts from the Indian Council of Medical Research noted that India has still not reached the peak of infections, and that cases are likely to continue to rise in the future.\n",

    "Question": "Can we trust antibody tests to tell who has been infected and who hasn't?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Testing",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & antibody tests",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "While COVID-19 diagnostic tests determine whether or not a person is currently infected with the virus, antibody tests are used to determine whether or not a person was infected with COVID-19 in the past. This occurs through a process in the immune system whereby the body develops a type of protein called  'antibodies' in response to the presence of a foreign object threatening the body, also called an \"antigen\", which in this case is the virus. The antibodies latch onto antigens and then work to remove them from the body. Antibodies are detected in the blood of people who are tested after infection; they show the bodyâs efforts to fight off a specific infection. This is why antibody tests can determine whether or not a person has had a specific virus.\n \nIn comparison, tests for active cases of the virus (such as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test) looks for the actual genes of the virus itself in a person. This means that COVID-19 has to be active and have a large enough amount infecting in a person in order for the test to be accurate. One difference between these tests is the fact that antibody tests look for prior infection from a virus using blood, whereas PCR-based tests are run on saliva or mucus samples to look for the virus's genetic material and diagnose people who are currently infected with the novel coronavirus. \n\nEach tests have different levels of of specificity (how well a test identifies patients who doÂ not have a disease) and sensitivity (how well a test identifies patients who do have a disease), and each have different ideal standards. \n\nFor instance, while with antibody tests the key metric is specificity, with diagnostic tests, the key metric is sensitivity. This is because an individual with a false negative test result may be mistakenly reassured that they are safe (just as one would with a false positive antibody test), and in turn pay less attention to basic prevention (e.g., social distancing).\n",
    "What our experts say": "Antibody tests are now available in many parts of the world, and they can play an important role in understanding COVID-19 trends and identifying groups at higher risk for infection.Â \nDiagnostic tests are never 100% accurate. Sometimes, a test will produce false positives (when you test positive for the virus, but don't have it) and false negatives (when you test negative for the virus, but you really have been infected). The antibody tests for COVID-19 are similar. To be able to trust the results of an antibody test, we must look at its ability to detect the presence of COVID-19 antibodies when they are present, and its ability to confirm the absence COVID-19 antibodies when they are truly absent.Â \nIn the context of the current pandemic, it is important for us to reduce the amount of false positive test results that can occur by choosing a test that is highly specific. This means we must choose a test whose ability to correctly identify those without the disease is as accurate as possible, so that a negative test result truly means that person has not been infected with COVID-19. This is because an individual with a false positive test result may be mistakenly reassured that they are safe, and may pay less attention to basic prevention (e.g., social distancing).Â In this context, the U.S. CDC recommends choosing a test with very high specificity, perhaps 99.5% or greater. Irrespective of where people reside, they should choose the test available on the market with the highest specificity. However, it is important to note that at this stage of the pandemic, we don't know yet exactly what a positive antibody test means in practice. We are not sure yet if a positive antibody test means that the antibodies will give the person immunity (i.e. prevent them from getting sick again with COVID-19); and if they do, how long this protection can last (weeks? months?). Several studies are currently underway. \n",

    ],
    "Background & context": "COVID-19 has been shown to have varying effects on different individuals, including symptoms and secondary health effects. This range of outcomes makes it difficult to know the estimate length of impact COVID-19 might have on an individual. One example of a secondary outcome is [myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome][1]Â (ME/CFS) â a long-term reappearance of symptoms â clusters of which have followed many infectious outbreaks. Increased data and corresponding analysis will help to provide more empirical evidence on how long COVID-19 adversely impacts individuals, what symptoms are most prevalent, and what secondary outcomes are most common. \n\n  [1]: https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html\n",
    "What our experts say": "Because the COVID-19 virus is new, we still don't know why some people might become sick longer than othersâbut we do know that people infected with COVID-19 who have severe symptoms tend to have symptoms for longer than those with mild cases. \n\nDifferences in immune responses, including lower levels of antibody production, can impact how long patients remain sick with COVID-19. A study from Portugal published in June 2020 found that some patients who took longer to have two consecutive negative tests showed milder symptoms and lower antibodies levels.\n\nCOVID-19 can impact many organs, which might help explain why the virus can cause symptoms that continue over a longer period of time in some patients. Akiko Iwasaki, a Yale immunology doctor, believes some potential reasons the virus lasts longer in some patients is because the virus might remain in one of the organs that is not tested by nasal swabs; that non-living parts of the virus can still cause your immune system to overreact like the virus is still alive and reproducing in your body when it isn't really doing that; and the virus might not be present in your body any longer, but your immune system is stuck in the state of fighting it off. \n\nAdditionally, after becoming infected with different viruses, your body can take a while to heal. So even if you don't have the virus anymore, you may continue coughing and not be able to breathe as well as you normally do, since your throat and lungs have yet to fully heal and recover.\n\nCurrently, the majority of patients infected with COVID-19 have symptoms for 2-6 weeks.\n\n\n",

    ],
    "Background & context": "Sewage contains valuable information on human health as viruses, bacteria, and chemical metabolites are excreted in urine and stool and provide a readout of an individualâs health status. In some diseases, people excrete viruses before they show symptoms, meaning that sewage can provide an early indicator of disease spread before people start seeking care. The technical term for analyzing sewage as a source of public health information isÂ [Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE)][1]. \n(Source: [Biobot Analytics][2])\n\n  [1]: https://cen.acs.org/environment/water/monitor-health-citiesresidents-look-further/96/i18\n  [2]: https://www.biobot.io/\n",
    "What our experts say": "SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19. It leaves the human body through our waste, so flushing the toilet with that waste means traces of the virus can be found in  sewage water. This is why COVID-19 has been recently detected in sewage water in regions that have tested for it. By collecting water from sewers, scientists in the U.S. and Europe are now testing sewage for the virus, using it as a collective sample to measure infection levels among thousands of people. Recent studies have shown that sewage water can be used as an early diagnostic tool for determining where potential COVID-19 cases might be occurring in a city. A recent study showed that measuring virus levels in municipal sewage helped researchers predict where forthcoming COVID-19 cases would be coming from a week before people began testing positive for the virus in that area. They did this by comparing the amount of virus found in the sewage water with the amount of confirmed cases in an area's hospitals. \nWe have observed that estimating the true number of COVID-19 cases is extremely challenging; these estimates often lead to underestimating the true scope of the pandemic in a community because many people are never tested for the virus even if they are ill. Moreover, asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms may never seek out testing and therefore won't be counted; but they can still transmit the virus. In this context, measuring overall virus levels in sewage over time could indicate the scope of the pandemic; indicate whether an outbreak is growing or shrinking; and can act as a surveillance system that would allow to detect new waves of an outbreak before patients develop symptoms and go to hospitals. \n\n(Source: [Biobot Analytics][1])\n\n  [1]: https://www.biobot.io/\n",

    ],
    "Background & context": "Most disease-causing agents, such as viruses and bacteria, stay within one host species, with many barriers preventing a jump from animals to humans. When a disease does break down the barriers between animals and people, itâs called a zoonotic disease. It's rare to have that jump result in a global outbreak, but even more rare to result in a global pandemic, as we're experiencing now. These jumps are becoming more commonplace, likely due to climate change. According to Margaret Wild, an expert in wildlife diseases and a professor at Washington State University in the U.S., âThese diseases donât transmit to humans often, and when they do, itâs typically when we push natural systems by destroying animal habitat or crowding different species together with people in a marketplace.â \n",
    "What our experts say": "While scientists have hypothesized that COVID-19 came from snakes, pangolins, bats, and other creatures, we still don't know exactly which animal passed the virus to humans, or how many species it might have impacted along the way. Scientists have determined that the virus did come from animals, not humans, and was first traced to a wet market in Wuhan, China. Many countries are hoping an independent investigation will take place to determine when and how COVID-19 first entered the human population, and at exactly what location. Many experts believe that the virus is a \"wild\" one, meaning that one animal species transmitted the virus to another species before it was spread to humans. The only way to determine exactly which animal the virus came from is to find the original animal species in the wild.\n",

    "Question": "How are migrant laborers in India being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Transmission",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & migration",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "India"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on migrant laborers are being documented globally as a result of poor or crowded working conditions, inadequate living conditions, risk of contracting the virus while traveling for work, and low access to quality healthcare, among other factors. Migratory and seasonal agricultural workers (MSAWs) have been documented to disproportionately infectious diseases, like COVID-19, along with a host of other serious health problems including diabetes, malnutrition, infectious diseases, pesticide poisoning, and injuries from work-related machinery. These health issues are exacerbated by the transitory culture of this population group, which makes it difficult to develop a relationship with a healthcare provider, maintain treatment regimens, and track health records. For these reasons, MSAWs were inequitably impacted by India's sudden shut down, and by the sudden reopening. \nSource: <https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/migrant-health>\n",
    "What our experts say": "India enacted one of the toughest nationwide lockdown policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and shut down all travel and movement with barely four hours notice on March 24, 2020. The lockdown disproportionately impacted the informal sector of India (the part of any economy that is not regulated by the government), and left thousands of migrant laborers and daily wage earners stranded. With buses and trains shuttered, migrant laborers had to walk hundreds of kilometers back to their villages, and many died along the way. \n\nIndia's COVID-19 response has been criticized for inadequately accounting for the needs of the most marginalized and vulnerable residents who lacked resources to cope with the abrupt lockdown. Now that the lockdown has ended, the Supreme Court of India has ordered states to identify stranded migrant laborers and facilitate their return to their hometowns. Several states, including West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar, and Jharkhand, have reported spikes in infections as more than 10 million migrant workers return to their homes following the easing of lockdown measures. The actual impact of migration on COVID-19 cases is difficult to ascertain, since testing has also improved, but the sudden influx of migrant laborers has made it even more difficult for the state healthcare institutions to treat and care for COVID-19 cases.\n",

    "Question": "Why are we repurposing old drugs to fight new diseases, and what might be the implications for COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Drug repurposing is a safe and successful pathway to speed up drug discovery and development compared with starting from scratch. Drug repurposing uses drugs that have either received regulatory approval,Â have failed in clinical trials or are in later stages of clinical trials, in order to leverage their detailed information on safety, toxicity, formulation, manufacturing plans, etc. Beyond the pandemic context, it is playing a vital role in several therapeutic areas, including, the discovery of new antibiotics and the development of drugs to combat Alzheimerâs disease. For example, Rifabutin is an antibiotic that has been around for decades and is used to treat tuberculosis, especially in people with HIV/AIDS. Recently, the drug was found to be effective against a superbug âAcinetobacter baumanniiâ which emerged during the Iraq War in military treatment facilities. This antibiotic had been overlooked until now for this disease but new technology has allowed scientists to discover new strengths of this long existing antibiotic. Another recent example of successful drug repurposing comes from a Phase II clinical trial result that has shown that a leukemia drug â nilotinib, usually used to treat cancer of the blood cells â has been found to be safe and well tolerated and effective in reducing the effects of Alzheimerâs disease.\n",
    "What our experts say": "There is a whole branch of medical research and pharmaceutical companies dedicated to drug repurposing. In practice, it has led to some therapeutic breakthroughs. For example, aspirin which is historically known for treatment of pain, fever or inflammation, has then be found to be effective against some cardiovascular diseases and is now being studied for potential anti-tumor growth in some cancers.\n\nDeveloping new treatments against new diseases often takes several years, if not decades. With the COVID-19 pandemic death toll increasing by the day, scientists are racing to find drugs that could prevent, treat or simply decrease the severity of COVID-19. Scientists have therefore turned their attention to studying drugs that have been studied for other viruses like the MERS coronavirus, HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), hepatitis C, ebola, influenza, etc. to see whether these drugs would also be effective against this new threat, COVID-19. Since these studies build on existing knowledge, the drug development timeline is substantially shortened, as is the required financial investment.Â Beyond the time-intensive process of developing new drugs, the advantages of repurposing drugs are numerous. First, existing drugs already have an existing safety track record, and have obtained regulatory approval or are in the later stages of clinical trials. Moreover, they have already been produced and may already be on the market, so plans to increase manufacturing can rapidly occur since the infrastructure already exists and does not need to be re-created. Because of this, scientists can focus on studying whether these drugs are effective against COVID-19, and if so, they can be brought to clinical use at the bedside of patients rapidly. Drug repurposing is very common in medical research as science rarely happens in a vacuum, but rather builds on previous iterations and experience. \n",

    "Question": "What do we know about the use of the drug avifavir to treat COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & avifavir",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Avifavir as a potential COVID-19 treatment has been emerging in visibility given that delivery of the drug to Russian hospitals began in June, following the approval of the Russian Ministry of Health. The approval follows promising but limited studies on Avifavir's accuracy in Russia, carried out in partnership of The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Russiaâs sovereign wealth fund, and the ChemRar Group. Studies on the drug had also been conducted in China â with seemingly promising results yet severe study limitations â as well as in the US, Italy, Japan and India. Avifavir works by selectively inhibiting RNA polymerase, necessary for viral replication, but data on its efficacy for COVID-19 is still inconclusive. 60,000 doses of the drug are set to be administered by the end of the month, according to RDIF. Trends in Russia's COVID-19 data, and in particular, additional evidence, are needed to determine efficacy. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Avifavir, a generic form of favipiravir, is an antiviral medication primarily used to treat severe cases of influenza. This medication is currently being studied in several countries as a potential experimental treatment for COVID-19, but we do not yet have enough evidence to determine whether or not Avifavir is an effective treatment for the virus. \n\nRecently in Russia, the health ministry approved the medication's use as a COVID-19 treatment by using an accelerated, short-term form of clinical trial with fewer people involved than traditional studies normally require. However, this study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal so the data, methods, and other study characteristics have yet to critiqued or evaluated by other scientists.\n\nThough this research is still occurring in the country, Russia's preliminary results suggested Avifavir might help reduce the number of days people are infected with the virus and shorten the duration of time people experience high-grade fevers while sick. \nBut until more studies are completed and a greater amount of data can demonstrate Avifavir's efficacy and safety, we do not have enough information to determine whether or not this medication can help treat COVID-19.\n",

    "Question": "Why are scientists warning about an increase in zoonotic diseases impacting humans?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Zoonotic diseases, like the virus SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 and Ebola virus disease, have shown a propensity for not only spilling over from animal reservoirs into humans, but sustained human to human transmission. These factors are influenced by several variables, such as climate change, human development and encroachment on natural environments. As a result, more focus as been placed on One Health, which underscores the relationship between human, animal, and environmental health. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Zoonotic diseases are infectious diseases that can spread from animals to humans. \"Spillover events\" (when a disease jumps from an animal to a human) have been known to cause outbreaks, like ebola virus disease. Since some infectious diseases can live within an animal without causing any illness to it, certain interactions with an infected animal can result in transmission to humans. \nRoughly 6 out of 10 known infectious diseases in people are zoonotic. Of all the emerging infectious diseases (a disease that has newly appeared in a population or has increased incidence in recent years), 3 out of 4 come from animals. Scientists are increasingly worried about zoonotic diseases as they are growing in frequency. In some cases which animal transferred infection to humans is unknown, like SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. As humans expand in the environment through globalization and infringement on undeveloped natural environments, like forests or jungles, the risk for exposure to zoonotic disease increases. Similarly, factors such as the exotic animal trade, the impacts of climate change, and the expansion of animal markets can cause zoonotic diseases to spread more rapidly and widely.\n\n",

    "Background & context": "There have also been cases of children with COVID-19 presenting with a multi system inflammation, especially around the heart, lung, and brain. There has been some evidence that adult patients with COVID-19 can develop heart-related conditions or complications related to pre-existing cardiac issues, leading to concerns for heart damage as a result of the infection. \n",
    "What our experts say": "COVID-19 infections can have an impact on blood and circulation through an increased risk of blood clotting. Blood clots are a clump of blood that has formed into a semi-solid or even gel-like state. Recent studies have found a concerning trend in blood clotting of COVID-19 patients. Studies from the Netherlands and France found that 20-30% of critically ill COVID-19 patients had blood clots, which can be dangerous. Many of these circulatory issues and the frequency of clots can lead to rashes, swelling of the legs, challenges in vascular access for medications, and even death. Severe clotting and circulatory issues, like COVID-19 associated blood clots, tend to occur more in severely ill patients rather than those with mild symptoms. \n",

    "Question": "Does COVID-19 impact men worse than women?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on men have been shown in a number of studies and hospital data. To clarify, the number of cases has appeared relatively equal, but vulnerability to the virus and mortality have not. A recent study from The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that of 5700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the New York City area, 39.7% of patients were female while 60.3% were male, demonstrating significantly disparate hospitalization rates based on sex. Sex and gender-based discrepancies are commonly documented in scientific literature, and are helpful for understanding how and why a health condition or disease manifests. For instance, women are twice as likely as men to become depressed, and men are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The gender dimensions of diseases are both physical as well as socially constructed. For example, higher estrogen levels in a women born biologically female is a determinant of health (biological), as is a higher likelihood to carry out domestic work (social). These dimensions also align with the terms sex and gender -- both of which are important to pay attention to in health. Sex describes primarily biological differences between men and women in origin, and gender describes differences primarily caused by social conditions, and can be thought as how one's chosen gender role and how they present. Public health efforts and policies have not always addressed the impacts of diseases acrossÂ sex and gender, but doing so can help us to understand both the biological and social dimensions of diseases like COVID-19, including who is most at risk and how to mitigate adverse outcomes.Â \n",
    "What our experts say": "Data from around the world has demonstrated the fact that men are impacted more greatly than women by COVID-19. For example, men are more likely to be hospitalized with severe symptoms of the virus and have higher mortality rates than women; and this finding is consistent across age groups and geographies. Researchers have been trying to understand the causes of this and are developing hypotheses to explain the differences between the immune systems' response to COVID-19 in men and women. At this stage, they are exploring these disparities using biological, social, and behavioral lenses. \nBased on previous studies with similar viruses, data has illustrated that sex differences in immunity are caused by both genetic as well as hormonal differences between women and men. For example, in females, hormones such as estrogen and progesterone may be protective against the virus, yet it is possible testosterone does the opposite for men. In terms of underlying illnesses, the data also illustrates that men are more likely to suffer from hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes than women. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have learned that these types of underlying conditions have been associated with a higher risk of complications from COVID-19. Behavioral factors may also explain this difference. For instance, females may be more likely to be frontline workers than men, which could create more risks for exposure. In terms of lifestyle, men tend to be more likely to be smokers, which is a risk factor for COVID-19 since it is a respiratory illness. \nFrom past studies, we also know that men are less likely to seek out medical care when there's a problem in comparison to women, which means they may interact with the health system at a later stage in the disease when symptoms are more severe. Similarly, in the case of COVID-19, men are less likely to engage in behaviors like mask-wearing and hand-washing, which may increase their risk of contracting the disease. \nSource: Dr. Sabra Klein (Johns Hopkins University)\n",

    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Recent studies have shown a concerting trend of delirium in COVID-19 patients, without predisposition for age or gender. Often, this manifests in the central nervous system. Unfortunately, documentation is often missed in 75% of delirium cases, which has been challenging for the identification of COVID-19 related incidents. As more research is pointing to COVID-19 delirium being a trend in hospitalized patients, there is a need to ensure documentation occurs. \n",
    "What our experts say": "COVID-19 delirium occurs in patients who have a sudden onset of mental disturbances that results in confusion and a lack of accurate perceptions regarding their environment and current state. Delirium itself is a change in mental abilities that results in the inability to think clearly, reduced awareness, and often emotional shifts. Delirium often occurs rapidly in patients and is frequently attributed to severe or chronic illness, changes in metabolism (the reactions and processes in your body that convert food into energy), infections, and other factors. Researchers and doctors have recently drawn attention to the fact that regardless of age, potentially 1/3 of COVID-19 patients can develop symptoms of delirium. More recent studies, though, have seen delirium in 20-30% of hospitalized patients with higher rates occurring in critically ill patients (upwards of 60-70%). Delirium can lead to longer hospital stays, which increases the risk for complications. \n",

    "Background & context": "Drug repurposing is a safe, and often successful, pathway to speed up drug discovery and development compared with starting from scratch. Drug repurposing uses drugs that have either received regulatory approval,Â have failed in clinical trials, or are in later stages of clinical trials, in order to leverage the detailed information collected on safety, toxicity, formulation, manufacturing plans, etc. There are many existing drugs that are undergoing testing for being repurposed for COVID-19 treatment, as well as many existing vaccines being studied for repurpose for COVID-19 prevention. For instance, biopharmaceutical company Merck is working on development of an experimental Covid-19 vaccine based on a measles vaccine. Another group is studying the effectiveness of Tuberculosis vaccine Bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) in protecting healthcare workers from COVID-19; and Company Emergent BioSolutions is in pre-clinical development of studying anti-SARS antibodies for COVID-19 prevention. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) is another option being tested based on indicators from past studies that OPV has helpful, general triggers for the immune system. According to the Polio Eradication Initiative, âA study is currently being discussed with various partners and vaccine manufacturers, including the US FDA, the outcomes of which will be carefully assessed to determine potential use in the context of the spread of SARS-CoV2 until the time when specific vaccines and antiviral therapies are ready.â\n",
    "What our experts say": "It's too early to know. Successful discovery and safe delivery of a vaccine are very challenging. In the pandemic context we are in, many scientists are turning to existing drugs and vaccines to try and see if they can repurpose them to tackle COVID-19, especially since their safety profiles, side effects, and effectiveness are already known. Similarly, the safety track record of the oral polio vaccine is also known, and scientists are now studying its efficacy against COVID-19. The hypothesis these scientists have suggested is that the oral polio vaccine â a weakened version of the live polio virus â is assumed to trigger a general immune response in the body - production of antibodies against a foreign organism to be protected in the future if infected again with the same organism. When the body's immune system engages this response to fight off the unknown virus, scientists believe the body will develop antibodies specific to the novel coronavirus, the virus that causes COVID-19. However these are early studies occurring in animal models only at this stage and with no results yet. Moreover, there is no consensus yet among scientists as to whether choosing the oral polio vaccine as a candidate was a good idea in the first place. Some note that there are risks in introducing the oral polio vaccine in some populations which is why in most of the world, doctors have phased out the oral formulation in favor of the inactivated polio vaccine, which is more widely used today.\n",

    "Question": "What do we know so far about dexamethasone as a potential treatment for COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Treatment",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 and dexamethasone",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Dexamethasone has recently been in the news due to its alleged early success in the RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy) trial, led by a team from Oxford University in the UK. This study is the world's largest and was launched in March to test six potential COVID-19 treatments - five pre-existing medications and convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients - to determine whether or not they can help treat cases of COVID-19. Though this study has received significant media attention since the search for any potential treatments is urgent, no study has been published by the RECOVERY team as of yet and no other countries have approved dexamethasone for severe cases of COVID-19. \n\n\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "Dexamethasone is a low-cost, anti-inflammatory medication that is part of the corticosteroid family. Corticosteroids function similarly to the cortisol produced in the body's adrenal glands yet they are synthetically made. Corticosteroids are commonly prescribed to suppress the immune system and reduce swelling and itching common to allergic reactions. \nDexamethasone has been widely used since the 1960s, but it has recently been part of several studies exploring potential therapies for COVID-19. In the RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy) Trial at Oxford University (UK), the largest COVID-19 drug trial to date, researchers studied the impact of dexamethasone by comparing the roughly 2,000 patients who received the medication with the 4,000 patients who did not receive the medication. They found that the mortality risk was lowered for patients with severe cases of COVID-19 who were on ventilators or receiving oxygen. For patients with mild cases of COVID-19, beneficial effects were not observed. \nDexamethasone has not been approved as an official treatment for COVID-19 outside the United Kingdom thus far, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has urged caution since these results are preliminary, have yet to be evaluated through the peer-review process, and represent findings from only one trial. Despite this, the medication is currently being used in several countries as a part of various treatment strategies for COVID-19. The WHO has also recently added dexamethasone and other steroids into its treatment guidelines for COVID-19.\nIn two other recent studies using corticosteroidal medications (including dexamethasone) as potential treatments for COVID-19, one found a reduction in the number of days patients required ventilator support, and the other found that the corticosteroid medications were associated with an increased duration of illness (among other adverse impacts). Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, are still an unproven treatment for COVID-19.\n",

    "Question": "What are dual treatments and are there any available for COVID-19 right now?",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Given the current absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, researchers are urgently looking for treatments for the disease. To this end, there is a wide range of both existing drugs (i.e. approved and regulated for different health conditions) and potential new ones being tested globally. These tests are being conducted in laboratories and animal and clinical studies, and once proven effective they are moved onto clinical trials. In addition to studies on singular drugs, researchers are testing what are known as combination therapies, in which two or more drugs are taken to treat a single disease. The rationale for combination therapy is that different drugs work through different mechanisms, and grouping more than one together can increase the treatment's efficacy,  reduce treatment duration, and reduce the likelihood of drug resistance.\n",
    "What our experts say": "\"Combination treatments\" are the use of two or more drugs to treat a single disease.Â Currently, there are no combination treatments (also known as dual treatments) that are officially approved for use to treat COVID-19. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, announced on June 23, 2020 while testifying before a House committee on the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic that Remdesivir is being used in combination with anti-inflammatory drug baricitinib. An NIH clinical trial has been underway since May to test the efficacy of the combined treatment, with results not yet released.\n\nOnly three standalone drugs have officially received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) in the US; these include the anti-viral remdesivir, anti-malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (which the FDA later issued a warning for),Â and a drug used to sedate patients that are on a ventilator. (These EUAs do not constitute a formal approval of the drug, but rather a possibility given to American doctors to use chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 if the doctor has no other options and after discussing with the patients the risks involved.)\n\nThough no combination treatments have yet to be formally approved for use, they are being widely tested. One example of a combination therapy being tested is the dual use of drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, which are in use to treat (not cure) HIV. The combination of these two drugs is known under the brand name Kaletra. Studies are still relatively inconclusive, but most have shown Kaletra to be ineffective for improving COVID-19 outcomes. One study, however, found that when taken with two other drugs â ribavirin and interferon beta-1b â the virus took less time to clear from the patient's body. There are a number of limitations from this trial that warrant further testing. \n\nOther studies testing combination therapy are focusing on pairs with remdesivir, given that it's the treatment with the most promising evidence thus far. One study is testing whether remdesivir increases in effectiveness if taken with an anti-inflammatory drug known as baricitinib. Another is testing the combination of remdesivir with the drug leronlimab, an antiviral that has also has shown to have some anti-inflammatory benefits. \nThese studies will get us closer to understanding if certain combination therapies might be effective for treating COVID-19.\n",

    "Question": "How does COVID-19 differ from malaria?",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "Nigeria"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Malaria is a disease caused by Plasmodium parasites carried by female Anopheles mosquitoes. It's a disease that occurs in over 100 countries. Nearly half of the global population is at risk of malaria, disproportionately people in low- and middle-income countries. According to the latest World Health Organization's World Malaria Report, there were 228 million cases and over 400,000 deaths in a year, with most of the fatalities occurring in Africa. \n\nWith global attention currently focused on COVID-19, public health advocates are calling attention to other diseases that also need to be addressed during this time. For example, the Global Fund reports that a majority of malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS programs may face disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent publication in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases raises specific concerns about screening challenges for countries with malaria, due to similarities of symptoms such as fever with COVID-19. \n\nMalaria has also been linked to COVID-19 because of news coverage on hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria with its overuse contributing to the spread of chloroquine resistance across the world. \n",
    "What our experts say": "COVID-19 and malaria are two different diseases with different ways of being spread and caught. Malaria is spread by mosquitoes, and humans become infected by mosquito bites. COVID-19 is spread by respiratory droplets that we inhale through our nose or our mouth. \n\nCOVID-19 and malaria have been incorrectly linked for several reasons. Firstly, around the world, hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria, received extensive news coverage because there were claims that the drug was effective against COVID-19. A few clinical trials and studies investigated hydroxychloroquine and found no evidence that the drug was effective against COVID-19. In some unfortunate cases, adverse events occurred in people taking this medication. \n\nSecondly, malaria and COVID-19 share some symptoms, although the list of COVID-19 symptoms currently grows and changes every day. Malaria symptoms usually appear 10-15 days after the infective mosquito bite and the first symptoms a patient feels are fever, headache, and chills. On the other hand, people infected with COVID-19 usually develop symptoms within 5 days and, in some cases, infected people never develop symptoms at all. \n\nFinally, there is a difference between fevers caused by malaria and those caused by COVID-19. Often malarial fevers are cyclical, reoccurring at predictable times based on which strain of malaria was contracted. In comparison, fevers caused by COVID-19 do not appear to occur in cycles. The most common COVID-19 symptoms are: fever, dry cough and tiredness. Less common symptoms include: aches and pains, sore throat, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, headache, loss of taste or smell, a rash on skin, or discoloration of fingers or toes. \n\n\n",

    "Background & context": "With efforts to find therapeutic options for the millions of patients suffering with COVID-19, there has been a rapid pace at drug evaluation. While some treatments are being evaluated and generic versions might be approved, there is still not enough data to confirm specific treatments for COVID-19 patients. Studies have found successful outcomes with Remdesivir, which has been approved in several countries. While these emergent use applications are an encouraging sign, it is important to monitor patients closely and report their outcomes or negative side effects. \n",
    "What our experts say": "SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 is a new infectious disease and, while there has been a lot of research aimed at identifying possible treatments, many therapies remain under investigation for both safety and effectiveness.Â \nÂ \nIn a recent study funded by Gilead Sciences, a biopharmaceutical company, 53 patients with severe cases of COVID-19 were prescribed Remdesivir, and researchers observed clinical improvements, including a decreased need for breathing support, in 68% (36 of 53 patients) of the participants. While the initial data looks promising for this drug, it is important to note that this initial study was small and the drug has not been rigorously studied for COVID-19. In addition, the study did not include patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 symptoms.Â \nÂ \nFavipiravir is also considered to be a possible treatment for COVID-19. A small study showed the virus being reduced faster with the drug in comparison to other medications. Without further study, there is not enough evidence suggesting effectiveness and safety.\n\nIn general, studies remain underway, and it is too early to determine which medications may be effective therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients. At present, Remdesivir has been given emergency use authorization in the U.S. and approval in Japan for severe COVID-19 cases. When either Remdesivir or Favipiravir is prescribed, it is important that medical providers monitor the patient's clinical condition noting effectiveness and possible negative side effects. Taking either drug without medical supervision is not recommended and may be harmful.Â \n",

    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "In May 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci, an internationally-renowned medical expert and head of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, noted that he hoped that a vaccine would be available in the first half of 2021, 12-18 months after the virus that causes COVID-19 was first identified. On June 23, 2020, he stated that efforts are still on track to produce a vaccine by the end of 2020 or early 2021, which would be a record-breaking timeframe for vaccine development. \n\nThe rush for a COVID-19 vaccine is unprecedented in its speed, the number of labs and companies working to develop one, and the global pressure to develop a safe, effective vaccine on such a large scale. Prior to COVID-19, the shortest amount of time it took to develop a vaccine was for mumps and took roughly four years. Scientists have been working on a vaccine for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) for 20 years and still have yet to find a successful one. Because scientists discovered the genetic sequence of COVID-19 so rapidly, and so many groups are working around the clock to develop an effective vaccine, with unparalleled funding,Â the public health, medical, and pharmaceutical fields are hopeful to have a vaccine available much more quickly. Even after a vaccine is developed, adequate manufacturing, supply chain, and distribution networks also need to be coordinated in order to get the vaccine to people across the world.\n",
    "What our experts say": "The timeline for vaccine availability is still unclear, since the development and testing processes normally take many years. \n\nThere are currently more than 200 potential vaccines for COVID-19 under development around the world. Each potential vaccine must be thoroughly tested to determine whether it has any harmful side effects, whether it can prevent disease in other mammals, and whether it successfully produces antibodies, which are the biological tools or instructions our immune systems need to defend  against the virus. \n\nScientists also need to assess how the immune system responds to the vaccine in general, which takes time. Even with an expedited timeline and regulatory approval process, researchers must ensure adequate clinical testing and adherence to regulatory standards, manufacturing, and quality control processes. Given the high rate at which possible vaccines drop off during the testing process, and potential manufacturing constraints, it will be difficult to produce, test, and scale a vaccine before 2021. \n",

    "Question": "Why are Brazil's cases surging right now?",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Despite the COVID-19 risk factor of older age being favorable for Brazilâs relatively younger population, Brazil has seen a surge in the number of cases. Initially, transmission of the virus was limited to the larger cities of SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro but now has moved inland into smaller cities. Thirteen million people in Brazil live in favelas, in close proximity to one another with lack of access to clean water. This makes the physical distancing and hygiene conditions necessary to prevent transmission of the virus very difficult. Smaller cities also have weaker health systems and fewer health care professionals to prevent the spread.\n\nThere has also been criticism of data suppression by the Brazilian government, and some opinions suggest that the actual cases could be seven times higher than the official figures.\n\nEasing of preventative measures like opening up of malls and beaches and crowding of people is another reason to see increases in the number of cases. The president of the country has criticized state governments that are making efforts to combat the pandemic. With a president who denies the pandemic as a âcold,â the political turmoil at the center has led to two health minsters being fired or quitting, leaving no public health expert to advise the leadership.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Brazil has reported over 1.2 million cases and 54,000 deaths as of June 26, 2020. The recent surge in cases is mainly stemming from the country's densely populated regions, such as Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro. Studies estimate that 25% of the Brazilian population in Sao Paolo did not adequately adhere to quarantine guidelines, and the presence of densely packed low-income neighborhoods known as favelas has exacerbated the spread of the virus. In a new study, researchers conducted over 3,000 rapid tests in six of the city's most densely populated neighborhoods and found that infection rates were far higher than the official estimates: some studies had previously estimated that 9.5% of people in Sao Paolo were infected, but the most recent estimates from the largest favela in Sao Paola indicated almost 25% of people who were tested were positive. \n\nMedical experts attribute the surge in cases in major cities to relaxed quarantine and isolation measures. Major cities in the country have lifted lockdown measures, and reopened restaurants, shops and businesses. Another research study found that more than 75% of the confirmed cases are from the relatively densely populated southern and southeastern regions of Brazil, and the exponential growth in COVID-19 cases has stemmed from difficulties in effective social distancing. The study reports that many informal workers are continuing to work and information regarding minimum infection prevention and control measures, including hand washing and social distancing, has not been effectively communicated and followed.\n",

    "Question": "Why are meat and pork plants having so many outbreaks?",
    "Status": "Published",

    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & meat processing plants",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Over the past few months, there have been news stories about virus outbreaks at U.S. meat processing facilities. With many ill workers, some meat processing facilities closed temporarily, which resulted in a decrease in meat and pork in markets and grocery stores. \n\nPeople who live or work in places where they are close to other people are at increased risk of getting and spreading COVID-19. While separating employees from one another by at least 6 feet (2 meters) or implementing COVID-19 specific sanitation guidelines have been effective in controlling spread of the virus in some work environments, these control measures have been difficult to implement in meat/pork processing facilities.Â Â Furthermore, employee attendance and sick leave policies, crowded living conditions, and limited protective equipment availability and use may also contribute to COVID-19 spread. To reduce the spread of COVID-19 in meat/pork processing facilities, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests using routine symptom screening as well as âimproving physical distancing, hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfection, and medical leave policies, and providing educational materials in languages spoken by workers.â\n",
    "What our experts say": "Meat processing plants have become major hotspots for coronavirus outbreaks because employees work in close proximity to one another, which makes social distancing very difficult. Across the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that 4,913 COVID-19 cases and 20 deaths have been reported among approximately 130,000 workers at 115 meat processing facilities in 19 states. Many meat processing plants have failed to provide basic protections like face masks, plexiglass barriers between workers, or paid sick leave to frontline employees. The Tyson Fresh Meats Plant in Washington State, the largest meat-packing plant in the state, was temporarily closed in April after more than a 100 employees tested positive for COVID-19. The plant has since resumed operations after testing all employees, but unions and health officials alike have advocated for greater health protections for workers, including adequate social distancing measures, even if it slows operations. \n",

    "Question": "Can the coronavirus spread when we flush the toilet?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Research shows that the pressure from flushing a toilet creates tiny droplets in the air that can rise as high as three feet above the toilet. This simulation was modeled for toilets in general without the SARS-CoV-2 virus, however, and it cannot be confirmed if the virus can spread through such plumes. Research conducted in two hospitals in China showed that aerosols were found in higher concentrations in a toilet of a hospital in Wuhan. However, the infectivity (strength of the virus to attack a person) is not known. It is also unknown if the aerosols collected were deposited from the breathing, coughing, or via the toilet flush. Since there is a possible risk, albeit low, public health experts recommend wearing masks inside public restrooms, closing the lid before flushing, keeping the toilets well ventilated and exhausts working at all times, and washing your hands with soap and warm water for 20+ seconds.\n",
    "What our experts say": "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, feces of some patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 have been shown to carry the virus. This has caused many to question the safest way to use the toilet so as to prevent any COVID-19 infection from potentially spreading when the toilet is flushed. The reason many people are concerned about this topic is that it has been discovered that the virus leaves the human body through our waste, which is why it has been found in the feces of infected individuals. When we flush waste down the toilet, traces of the virus may linger in the air long enough to be inhaled. Studies have shown that during a toilet flush, particles can be transported more than 3 feet (1m) upward and can float in the air for more than a minute. It is unknown if the particles that linger in the air are infectious, and how many virus particles are needed to cause an infection. Since there are many unknowns, by precaution, public health experts recommend closing the lid before flushing and wearing masks inside public restrooms.\n",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "In the early phases of the COVID-19 outbreak, masks were not recommended as a standard measure to prevent the spread of infection. Because critical protective equipment (including masks) was reserved primarily for healthcare workers, many health organizations could not advocate for the use of masks by the general public until the needs of medical teams were met. Additionally, there was a lack of evidence regarding different types of masks needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Early in the outbreak, the new virus had also not been thoroughly investigated by teams focused on respiratory droplets and aerosolized particles with masks.Â As scientists and medical experts have learned more about the virus and its spread, the use of face masks to prevent illness as a result of COVID-19 has become a routine recommendation in many parts of the world.\n\nFace masks and cloth face coverings, in combination with frequent hand-washing and social distancing measures, have been shown to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.Â Face mask safety also includes carefully and safely putting on, wearing, and removing the mask.Â The mask should cover both the nose and mouth, and it should be snug against the face.Â Â It is important not to touch the outside of mask while it is worn or when it is removed, and hand washing before and after mask removal is recommended.Â Â Finally, according to the World Health Organization, cloth masks should be washed daily.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Wearing a face mask is both safe and recommended to slow the spread of COVID-19. The United States Centers for Disease Control  recommends widespread use of cloth face coverings to prevent spread from people who might have the virus that causes COVID-19 without realizing it. While surgical masks and N-95 masks are in short supply and should be reserved for healthcare workers, cloth face coverings should always be worn when interacting with other people in close proximity (including but not limited to grocery shopping, ordering food at a restaurant, interacting with people within 6 feet in outdoor spaces). \n\nYou should clean your hands before touching the mask, make sure the mask covers your nose and mouth, and ensure the mask fits tightly on your face without leaving exposed spaces. Additionally, you should avoid touching the front of the mask, avoid taking the mask off when talking to other people; only remove the mask by touching the straps; wash your hands after removing the mask; wash the mask in soap and detergent with hot water at least once a day; and avoid sharing masks with others or leaving used masks around other people. While mask wearing is recognized as safe and is advised by the World Health Organization and other leading health advisory groups, there are cases where masks should not be used.Â For instance, masks are not safe for children under 2 years of age, people who have trouble breathing in general, or individuals who are unconscious or who would be unable to remove the mask without help.Â \n\nSeveral cities and states, such as New Orleans and Washington, have mandated the use of face masks to slow the spread of the virus. However, masks alone are not enough. In addition to wearing a mask to help stop the spread of the virus, public health experts encourage social distancing (staying at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others) as well as frequent and thorough hand washing. \n",

    "Question": "How reliable are temperature checks for re-opening businesses?",

    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & business reopenings",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Many businesses and organizations are following World Health Organization (WHO) and U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommendations for measuring the temperature of every employee at a business location, though this is not a requirement or recommendation in every state in the United States or every country in the world. As temperature checks are not a stipulation to re-open a business in most countries, many business owners have opted not to perform this task.\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "Checking people for fever before they interact with others has been proposed as a means to help reduce transmission of disease. Some countries such as China and South Korea have widespread checks of body temperature to help identify individuals with fevers in offices, restaurants, airports, or other popularly-frequented locations. As a standalone measure, checking for fever is insufficient to prevent disease transmission because of how asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic people can get others sick. Diagnostic testing for COVID-19 - not temperature checks - is a much more accurate, effective means of determining whether or not employees might be infected with the virus. Additionally, temperature testing may be difficult to implement in some locations due to limited resources, privacy concerns, and other reasons. \n\nSome experts have cited concerns about workplace surveillance and privacy while using infrared temperature checks. There are also questions about the effectiveness and accuracy of these workplace thermometers, especially considering how many pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic patients might not have any symptoms during the duration of their illness. Lastly, fevers might be indicative of other factors or illnesses unrelated to COVID-19; for example, elevated body temperature is commonly observed in people who are physically exerting energy or under great stress.\n",

    ],
    "Background & context": "News headlines have mentioned llamas participating in research with the potential to help treat and prevent COVID-19. Animals ranging from llamas to sharks have been used to help produce antibodies similar to those used by human immune systems. Camelids, including llamas, camels, and alpacas, are particularly effective at antibody production and make simpler and smaller \"single-domain\" antibodies that are called nanobodies.  According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, special features of nanobodies include stability for storage of therapeutics and the potential for delivery through an inhaler directly to the lungs, which may be beneficial for respiratory diseases like COVID-19. There is widespread interest in antibodies against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, for use in helping infected patients recover and protecting more people from getting sick. \n\nIn 2016, researchers from the University of Texas worked with a Belgian research team to study the effect of an injection of a type of coronavirus in a 4-year-old llama named Winter. Though the virus was similar to COVID-19, it was not exactly the same. In this early study, the virus that caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was used. The goal of this injection was to see if Winter's body might produce nanobodies in response to exposure to this coronavirus. Luckily, Winter produced two antibodies: one that fought off MERS and the other that fought off SARS. The scientists further studied the antibodies in a lab and were eventually able to use them to produce nanobodies, which might help prevent SARS and MERS viruses once they enter a body's cells. The current research into llamas to treat COVID-19 stems from this process. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Llamas are being used in research to produce antibodies that _may_ help develop therapeutics to treat and prevent COVID-19 in humans. Like humans, llamas naturally produce antibodies. Antibodies are special proteins that are made from plasma cells (a type of white blood cell), and they help the body to fight \"antigens\" including viruses, bacteria, and other threats that can make people sick. \n\nLlamas are able to produce a special type of antibody called a 'nanobody.' Nanobodies are about a quarter of the size of the antibodies that humans produce and, because they are so small, nanobodies are more stable, can live for a long time, and are able reach tiny, hard-to-reach areas of the body to help treat infected cells. Using a known process, scientists are looking to create a treatment for COVID-19 using llama nanobodies. Though animal studies have only just begun and researchers are not yet ready for human studies, there is hope that COVID-19 antibody treatments made possible by llamas could become preventive in the future. \n",

    "Question": "What do we know so far about COVID-19 and alkalinity?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "In chemistry, _alkaline_ is an adjective that is sometimes used to describe a subset of bases that dissolve in water. Alkalinity, however, is a different term used by oceanographers and hydrologists to describe the capacity of water to resist pH changes that would make it more acidic, in contrast to basicity which refers to a measurement on the pH scale above 7. When food is described as alkaline, this is often based on misconceptions about the impacts of eating food on the pH of the body. Fluids associated with various organs and tissues in the body have different typical pH levels; for example, the stomach operates at an acidic pH for digestion. Eating food does not have a significant impact on blood pH as this is regulated by the body to stay relatively neutral (pH of 7.35 to 7.45).\n\nOne popular social media post incorrectly applies a research study about another type of coronavirus called mouse hepatitis type 4 (MHV4), and also lists food items with pH values that are inaccurate.Â For example, lemons are falsely listed to have a pH of 9.9 (the true pH is closer to 2-2.6) and avocados with a pH of 15.6 (the true pH is likely 6.27-6.58). For reference, the pH scale only goes from 0 to 14, and food products are generally within a pH range of about 2 to 8. **It is important to note that eating more alkaline food does not change the risk of COVID-19 infection or treat COVID-19.**\n",
    "What our experts say": "Eating more acidic or alkaline foods is not related to an increased or decreased risk of COVID-19 infection. Widely circulated social media posts falsely suggest that the pH of COVID-19 ranges from 5.5 to 8.5. Often these posts advise readers to eat alkaline foods (specifically fruits and vegetables) with a pH of more than 8.5 to prevent COVID-19.Â Â Viruses themselves do not have pH levels, because they are not water-based solutions. \n\nIn chemistry, pH (power of hydrogen, or potential for hydrogen) is a scale used for water-based solutions to indicate if they are acidic (pH below 7, with a lower pH indicating a stronger acid), neutral (pH around 7), or basic (pH above 7, with a higher indicating a stronger base). Since viruses are not water-based, the pH scale does not apply to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the disease that causes COVID-19.\n\nWhile some illnesses or medications may cause blood pH levels to increase or decrease in our bodies, foods eaten as part of a regular diet do not have a significant impact on blood pH. Â Saliva and urine pH may change in response to diet, but these changes are variable from person to person and** will not prevent or cure COVID-19.**\n\nThe posts in question seem to consistently refer to a 1991 paper in which another type of coronavirus, the coronavirus mouse hepatitis type 4 (MHV4), was studied in mouse or rat cells in a solution with a pH of 5.5 to 8.5.Â Â Mice and rats are not the same as humans, and this study was not conducted in humans or on human cells. In addition, MHV4 is not the same as the SARS-Cov-2 virus that causes COVID-19, and this study was performed well before the SARS-Cov-2 was discovered in 2019.\n\nEating a well-balanced diet including a variety of fruits and vegetables can help support immune function which may help to prevent illness in general, but there is not enough evidence to suggest that a well-balanced diet would be effective in preventing or treating COVID-19.Â Â \n",

    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [

    "Background & context": "Rhodiola and forsythia are plants used in traditional Chinese medicine which have not been scientifically or clinically proven to prevent or treat COVID-19. While the use of traditional Chinese medicine is widespread in China and has been promoted by some government entities like the China National Health Commission, the World Health Organization warns that inappropriate use of traditional medicine can have negative health impacts and that more research is needed to determine the efficacy as well as safety of many traditional medicine practices. Traditional Chinese medicine is a branch of traditional medicine based on historical Chinese health practices passed through generations, including herbal medicines, acupuncture, and other techniques. Traditional medicine is used around the world but is considered a form of alternative medicine, different from formalized and science-based conventional medical care. Beyond safety and efficacy concerns for traditional medicine, there are also concerns about the use of certain species in traditional medicine that could lead to loss of biodiversity.\n",
    "What our experts say": "While there are historical uses for these herbal treatments, there have been no peer-reviewed studies to support the use of rhodiola, forsythia, or other tradtional Chinese medicines for COVID-19. Rhodiola is often used for stress, but has not been proven effective in treating COVID-19. Following the announcement from a Chinese official regarding approval of three herbal supplements for treatment, there was widespread concern regarding the lack of rigorous studies to support their use. As the outbreak is just six months old, it is important to stress that there is no proven treatment and many studies are being done to address these information gaps. \n",

    "Question": "Can you explain how the COVID-19 test using tears works?",

    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & Testing",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "There is a growing number of research studies as well as media reports about COVID-19 tests that use samples of tears, instead of nasal swabs, throat swabs, saliva collection, blood draws, or other bodily samples. Tears originate near the nasal cavity, and someone with COVID-19 can shed viral particles in their tears. \nLike nasal swab tests, COVID-19 tests using tears analyze the sample through polymerise chain reaction (PCR) and are currently proposed as a potential option for diagnostic testing (checking whether someone has an active infection), which is different from antibody testing (checking whether someone had a past infection and now has antibodies against COVID-19). It is important to note that COVID-19 tests using tears are still in the research and development phase.\nThe interest in COVID-19 tests using tears may be related to general interest in increasing the availability, accuracy, affordability, safety, speed, and ease of COVID-19 testing. For example, there is some interest in nasal swab test alternatives to reduce physical discomfort and to avoid inducing sneezing or coughing reflexes that could transmit virus particles to health care workers.\n",
    "What our experts say": "As of now, there is no consensus about whether or not tears can accurately detect the virus in an infected person, but early study results have shown a lower amount of the virus in tears than in other bodily fluids. Some researchers believe parts of the virus might be able to spread from a person's nasal cavity into their eyes, and eventually into tears in the inner corner of the eyes. Whether or not this type of testing will work is still uncertain as scientists have been testing many bodily fluids like semen, saliva, urine, and tears to determine whether or not the virus can be detected in them and if it can, how much. \n\nHumans produce tears in the back of their eye sockets, which is close to the nasal cavity where most COVID-19 tests are being done now. The nasal cavity is located at the back of the nose and is where the COVID-19 virus starts reproducing in people exposed to the virus.\n\nNasal swab tests are designed to collect samples from the nasal cavity that have some genetic material of the virus (DNA and RNA). Tear tests for COVID-19 would try to focus on this similar area of the head as there is a small, thin layer of tissue called the 'conjuctiva' that acts as a bridge between the nasal cavity and the eye socket. \n",

    ],
    "Background & context": "There have been some questions about using digital thermometers as more people use them to check for fever (higher than normal body temperature), one of the symptoms of COVID-19. While checking body temperature can be part of evaluating whether someone may have COVID-19, it is important to note that checking for fever alone is not enough to determine whether someone has COVID-19 in part because there are many causes of fever. In addition, some people with COVID-19 may not have any symptoms of illness or may have symptoms other than fever. Digital thermometers can also be inaccurate or used incorrectly. Checking body temperature with a digital thermometer is not a substitute for COVID-19 testing.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Digital thermometers do not damage your brain in any way. Digital thermometers are universally used with children and adults and can come in a wide variety of forms including oral, rectal, temporal artery (forehead), tympanic (ear), and axillary (armpit) versions. These thermometers require a sensor, which typically produces either a voltage, current, or resistance change when there is a change of temperature. These are all widely used and safe. There is no evidence to suggest that neurons or brain cells can be damaged in the process. \n\nOlder thermometers were glass tubes with mercury inside them. The mercury expanded and contracted based on the temperature of the subject. Now, digital thermometers are far more common and easier to read than traditional mercury-based thermometers, and digital thermometers are considered safer than mercury-based thermometers because mercury is toxic, and there is a possibility for exposure if the glass tube containing the mercury were to break. \n",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "COVID-19 access to viral testing (diagnostic tests that tell you if you are currently infected with the virus) has varied significantly during the course of the pandemic. In the US, testing was largely unavailable except for those with acute symptoms until recent months. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), specimens tested by both the CDC and public health labs multiplied by more than 12 times from the beginning of March to the beginning of May. Limited testing early in the pandemic has left gaps in the data, particularly with regards to asymptomatic cases; however, because testing was initially (and in some regions still is) limited, there has been confusion about the benefits. While viral testing is not perfect in terms of accuracy and will not alone slow the pandemic, it is a crucial piece of the response effort. If one can get regularly tested, one should. In the initial months of the pandemic, countries that rapidly scaled up viral testing capacity, such as South Korea, were able to better contain the spread of COVID-19 in comparison to countries that were slow to increase testing, such as the United States. \n\nSerology (antibody) testing has also varied in availability and recommended uptake since the onset of the pandemic. There has been less of an urgent push for serology testing because it does not tell you if you are currently infected and there is lacking evidence on how protective the antibodies are and their length of protection. Additionally, there is a chance that a positive result could be due to antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same coronavirus family (eg. the one that causes the common cold). The U.S. CDC has also issued warnings about the risk of high false positive rates in antibody tests. While antibody tests are an integral part of routine surveillance and particularly understanding disease prevalence and the frequency of asymptomatic infection, they should not be seen as a silver bullet to virus control. \n\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "Testing provides several benefits during a pandemic, including early diagnosis, contact tracing, prevention, and surveillance. Viral testing identifies if an individual is currently infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. At the individual level, it allows infected individuals who were potentially experiencing symptoms to be diagnosed and access the care they need. At the community level, viral testing prevents further infections since an infected individual can take all necessary precautions to not infect other people. It also allows public health experts to identify new cases and track the spread of the virus through contact tracing by following the chain of transmission. Viral testing is commonly used to test people who have symptoms of COVID-19 as well as caregivers, essential workers, travelers, and others who may not show active symptoms. \n\nSerology tests - also called antibody tests - are useful to find out if an individual has been previously infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. These kinds of tests look for antibodies in the blood, which determine if there was a previous infection. It allows public health experts to find out how many COVID-19 infections have occurred in the past, and to track what percentage of the population has been infected over time, which has important implications for surveillance. At a policy level, serology testing can guide guide social distancing or quarantine guidelines. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control use a serology surveillance strategy to better understand the spread of the virus by testing in different locations, at different points of time, and within different populations (ex. across age, ethnic and socioeconomic groups) in the United States. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the evidence surrounding serology testing and its link to immunity (protection) is still evolving. We do not understand fully if prior infection is evidence of immunity, know how long antibodies can protect the body, or whether patients can get infected again after a previous infection. \n",

    "Question": "How effective is it to use only a face shield to protect from COVID-19?",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "Nigeria"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Face shields are a type of personal protective equipment (PPE), along with masks, protective eye goggles, gloves, gowns, and other equipment. Proper use of PPE can help reduce the spread of COVID-19, yet some people are asking experts about minimum PPE recommendations. This may be due to access barriers (ex. cost, limited supply), use barriers (ex. heat, difficulty breathing, physical discomfort, aesthetics), cleaning and maintenance barriers, or other reasons. Face shields are easier to wear, disinfect, and reuse than cloth or surgical masks. It is important to remember that PPE is a risk reduction measure that lowers the chances of infection, which is different from risk avoidance measures (completely eliminating risks is not always possible, particularly when exposed to other people who could transmit COVID-19).\n",
    "What our experts say": "Wearing only a face shield to protect from COVID-19 is not as effective as wearing a mask, or wearing a face shield in combination with a mask. \nCloth face masks primarily protect people in close proximity to the mask wearer. This is because face masks cover a person's nose and mouth from all sides and are intended to trap droplets that are released when the mask wearer speaks, sneezes, coughs or sings. This is particularly relevant in the case of COVID-19 where many infected patients are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic and therefore can spread the virus to others without feeling any symptoms. Face masks also offer some protection to the wearer by filtering out virus particles trying to enter and reducing exposure to the virus coming from other people.\nFace shields primarily protect the person wearing it. This is because face shields have the advantage of protecting the entire face, including the eyes, and often prevent people from touching their faces. However, due to insufficient research to date, we do not know how effective face shields are at protecting people in close proximity to the person wearing the face shield, in case that person is infected with COVID-19. \n",

    "Question": "Can drinking alcohol prevent or cure COVID-19?\n",

    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "Nigeria"
    ],
    "Background & context": "There are rumors circulating that drinking alcohol can prevent or treat COVID-19. This might be related to how alcohol (with concentration levels above 60-70%) is being used as a disinfectant for hands and surfaces, but it is important to note that drinking alcohol does not destroy the novel coronavirus within your body.\n\nWhile alcoholic beverages typically contain ethyl alcohol (also known as ethanol), media reports suggest that some alcoholic beverages have been illegally adulterated with toxic substances that smell similar, causing additional deaths during the pandemic in some countries. There are also other alcoholic products, such as hand sanitizers, that are not meant for human consumption. Drinking other forms of alcohol, such as methyl alcohol (also known as methanol) in chemical disinfectants, can cause blindness, kidney disease, or death even in small quantities.\n",
    "What our experts say": "No, drinking alcohol does not prevent or cure COVID-19. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are recommended to disinfect hands and surfaces, but drinking or ingesting alcohol is in no way recommended. In fact, alcohol consumption could worsen COVID-19 symptoms and could weaken your body's ability to fight the virus, if you have lowered immunity. Excessive consumption of alcohol is a risk factor for many diseases, and alcohol should only be consumed in moderation, if at all.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) warns that drinking alcohol will not protect against infection or illness from COVID-19. In fact, alcohol consumption can reduce the immune system's ability to fight infection and increase the chance of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), one of the most severe symptoms of COVID-19. Additionally, alcohol consumption has other negative health consequences (ex. motor and cognitive impairments, mental health impacts, violence, pregnancy impacts, carcinogenic exposure, associations with several other diseases). In response to rising rates of alcohol consumption and alcohol being one of the most widely abused substances in the world, the WHO has advised that \"people should minimize their alcohol consumption at any time, and particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n",

    ],
    "Background & context": "Headlines from May 2020 widely touted ivermectin as a breakthrough drug with âastoundingâ results in patients with COVID-19. While the study has not yet been peer reviewed or published, preprint and press release information reports lower mortality in patients on ivermectin therapy in four Florida (US) hospitals. Many news reports also link back to a paper that reported results from testing the medication in cell cultureânot in humans. At present, clinical studies are ongoing, and the drug requires additional research to determine possible benefits and risks for patients with COVID-19.\n\nThough ivermectin is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for other illnesses and it has been shown to decrease the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in cell studies, it should not be prescribed for COVID-19 or taken without medical supervision.Â The US FDA has specifically issued multiple statements to further advise the public. First, they suggest that âwhile there are approved uses for ivermectin in people and animals, it is not approved for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. You should not take any medicine to treat or prevent COVID-19 unless it has been prescribed to you by your health care provider and acquired from a legitimate source.â In a later statement, the US FDA also suggested that people should not use Ivermectin intended for animals as a treatment for COVID-19.Â Â \n",
    "What our experts say": "As of now, there is not enough evidence to support the use of Ivermectin to treat COVID-19. \n\nIvermectin has been used to treat infectious diseases in humans and animals for over thirty years, primarily for treating parasitic roundworm infections in the intestinal tract, skin, and eyes. The medication has not been approved as a treatment for COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). A regional office of the WHO, called the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), has advised against the use of ivermectin for any purposes other than those for which its use is authorized. \n\nAs of now, PAHO and WHO recommend that the use of ivermectin for new uses like COVID-19 only be used in research studies so scientists can determine if using ivermectin is safe and effective. There are currently more than 30 studies on ivermectin underway.\n",

    "Question": "What is pool testing and why is it being used?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "On: COVID-19 & pool testing",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "There have been many headlines in the news about \"pool testing\" for COVID-19.  Pool testing for COVID-19 has already been implemented or is currently being considered in several places, particularly where there are large populations as well as limited time and supplies for testing. For example, Chinese health officials have used this method in Wuhan and Beijing to quickly test large numbers of people. U.S. federal health officials have also been discussing the potential for pool testing, informed by how this has been implemented in the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory when it was running low on testing reagents in March 2020 and has since reported 50-60% savings in reagents along with 20-30% savings in labor. Most health officials believe that the savings from pool testing will be limited outside of areas where the virus is rarely present. While pool testing alone is not expected to resolve the current bottlenecks in testing, this form of testing can be a helpful tool in some situations.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Pool testing, distinct from individual testing, tests a pool (or group) of people at the same time and is a form of testing that has been used for diseases like HIV/AIDS before the current COVID-19 pandemic. Normally, when a COVID-19 test is done using a nasal swab on a patient, that sample is then tested individually to determine if the virus is present, and this can take anywhere from 15 minutes to several days, depending on the abilities of the lab running the test. With pool testing, anywhere from roughly 3 - 50 samples are combined and all of the swabs are tested at once. If the test result from that pool test is negative, then all patients in that pool do not have the virus. If the result is positive, then each swab must then be tested one-by-one.\n\nPool testing, also called \"batch testing,\" is currently being used in order to test many more people for COVID-19 than individual tests alone. This is because instead of testing patients and then analyzing their samples individually to determine whether or not one patient has been infected with COVID-19, pool testing combines many samples and tests them at the same time. \n\nPool testing has gained popularity in recent months due to surging numbers of COVID-19 infections around the world. This method gives laboratories the ability to save time, test greater numbers of people, and use their resources most efficiently. These tests are most useful in places with large populations but a lower number of COVID-19 cases within that population, including group settings like schools or workplaces. In places with with a high rate of infections, this testing strategy would not be as beneficial since most patients would be tested individually either way. Another potential hurdle is that pool testing might lead to more false-negative tests. This is because if a patient does have the virus and it is present in their individual test sample, that sample will be diluted when it is combined with the rest of the samples from the larger group, possibly to the point where the viral load is undetectable. \n",

    ],
    "Background & context": "There have been studies and news articles circulating about a potential new strain of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Viruses mutate (or change) as part of their life cycle, by making errors when copying genetic code for reproduction. Not all mutations will create a different virus strain, as some mutations are silent (without observable effect), cosmetic (only appearance changes), or can disappear over time. RNA viruses, such as influenza and measles, lack a self-correcting mechanism and tend to be more prone to mutations compared to DNA viruses, such as herpes and human papillomavirus. Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that generally have been found to mutate slower than influenza. With the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, there have been isolates (or virus samples isolated from infected patients) reported to be slightly different in genetic sequence from the original isolates found in China. More research is needed to understand the implications of any mutations in SARS-CoV-2.\n",
    "What our experts say": "A recent handful of studies have claimed that newer strains of the COVID-19 virus in Europe and the United States spread more rapidly and are more infectious than the original strain of the virus that was first discovered in Asia in early 2020. However, at least one of these studies has yet to be peer-reviewed or published. As of now, there is no scientific consensus on these findings nor is there enough evidence to determine if they are accurate. \n\nViruses constantly change as they reproduce in order to keep spreading into more cells. These changes are called \"mutations,\" and though most mutations are not helpful to the virus, the changes that help the virus reproduce help the virus spread. These mutations create a new form of the virus, and each updated version we call a \"strain.\" In the case of COVID-19, this new strain is called the 'G614' and it impacts something called the \"spike proteins\" of the virus; the spiky parts on the outside of all coronaviruses that helps them get into the body of a person and attach to and infect more cells. The G614 strain has more spike proteins and they are less likely to break off from the virus when it is trying to invade the human body, so it is more likely to infect the person who has been exposed to it. In the earliest strains of the virus scientists were able to find, they agreed that these proteins were already very efficient and helped the virus infect millions of people through its use. With this new change in the number and strength of these spikes, researchers believe the G614 strain of the virus is roughly 10 times more infectious than the earliest versions studied in laboratories.\n\nHowever, these recent studies have shown that though it is easier for the new strain of the virus to infect people, it does not make these infections any worse or better than the other strains of COVID-19. So even if you are more likely to get sick from the virus, your chances of having severe symptoms are the same as they have always been, and you will most likely have a mild to moderate case.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Question": "Are any of the following foods or drinks, alone or in combination with other, effective in treating or curing COVID-19: turmeric, lemon, pineapple, onion, blackseed oil, honey, garlic, tea, ginger, zinc, or selenium?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background & context": "There are many fruits, vegetables, herbs, and dietary supplements that have been promoted as preventive therapies or cures for COVID-19. WhileÂ _some _of these nutrition-based therapies have theoretical links to scientific research, based on previously conducted cellular studies, animal studies, or human studies, there is not significant scientific evidence on their impacts against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The [World Health Organization][1] (WHO) and other health authorities have continually denounced these reports becauseÂ there is no current scientific evidence suggesting that specific foods or dietary supplements prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19. \n\nIt is important to be aware of possible interactions between medications and some dietary supplements, and there are known risks that accompany supplement use for some patients (i.e, pregnant or lactating women, patients with kidney or liver disease). Some supplement products have been found to not have the components that are advertised on the product packaging, and may contain varied doses, or may contain other contaminants (i.e. heavy metals, pesticides) or additives.\n\n**Turmeric:**Â The primary active compound in Turmeric, curcumin, has been extensively studied for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. In spite of its potential and successes in laboratory-based tests, most clinical trials in humans** **have not shown an effect, and more studies are needed to determine if or when curcumin may benefit people. Curcumin has not been studied in patients with COVID-19, though clinical trials have been proposed. The World Health Organization has a [specific statement][2] on their website suggesting that there is no current scientific evidence that turmeric prevents COVID-19. There is also no scientific evidence that turmeric can successfully treat or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Lemon:**Â Lemon is a great source of vitamin C and can be part of a healthy diet. The World Health Organization has a [specific statement][2] on their website suggesting that there is no current scientific evidence that lemon prevents COVID-19. There is also no scientific evidence that lemon can successfully treat or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Pineapple:**Â A variety of fruits (pineapple, mango, durian, and others) all may be included in a well-balanced diet to promote general health and well-being. The World Health Organization has a [specific statement][2] on their website suggesting that there is no current scientific evidence that these and other fruits prevent COVID-19. There is also no scientific evidence that fruits can successfully treat or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Onion:**Â As a member of the same family as garlic, onions are also known to have some antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory qualities, but studies are limited. To date, there are no studies that evaluate onions as a therapy for COVID-19, and there is no scientific evidence to suggest that onions will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Blackseed Oil**: (also called Nigella sativa) Black seed (or Nigella sativa) is used as a medicinal plant around the world and has been reportedly used to treat a variety of conditions from influenza to diabetes, inflammation to cough or fever. To date, black seed oil and its compounds have not been studied as a possible treatment or cure against COVID-19 in cell studies, animal studies, or human studies, though the idea has been proposed. Currently, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that black see oil will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Honey:**Â Honey may have some wound healing and antibacterial properties, but much of the published research focuses on topical (skin) application, which doesn't apply to COVID-19 because the virus is an internal infection. While it can be part of a healthy diet, honey is a source of sugar, and leading health organizations recommend limiting dietary sugar intake. Health experts have suggested that products like ginger, tea, or honey may make us feel better when we are sick, but that does not mean that these items cure or treat disease. There is also no scientific evidence that honey can successfully treat or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Garlic:**Â Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial and anti-tumor properties, though study results are often mixed and there are limitations, gaps, and shortcomings in the published evidence. While it has been widely studied in preparations as a supplement, extract, and food, there is currently no evidence that garlic will prevent or treat COVID-19. The World Health Organization has a [specific statement][3] on their website suggesting that âthere is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.â There is also no scientific evidence that garlic can successfully treat or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Tea:**Â Some teas may have health benefits, but evidence is limited because of difficulty studying the possible effect of tea alone. Health experts have suggested that products like ginger, tea, or honey may make us feel better when we are sick, but that does not mean that these items cure or treat disease. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that tea will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Ginger:**Â As a supplement, ginger is most commonly prescribed to help with nausea. Health experts have suggested that products like ginger, tea, or honey may make us feel better when we are sick, but that does not mean that these items cure or treat disease. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that ginger will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Zinc:**Â Zinc is a mineral that is used throughout the body and is needed for a healthy immune system. While zinc is available in many foods, use of zinc supplements has been shown to be helpful for wound healing and may shorten the duration of colds and acute diarrhea. Use of zinc should be guided by healthcare providers, since there are known side effects that may result from incorrect dosing. In addition, long-term zinc use is known to cause copper deficiency and is not recommended. There are clinical trials registered to study zinc (often in combinations with other vitamins, minerals, or medications) as a therapy for patients with COVID-19, but results are not available yet. While there are many scientists and health professionals that believe zinc may be a helpful therapy for COVID-19 based on its known benefits with other conditions, there is not enough scientific evidence to suggest that zinc supplementation will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19.\n\n**Selenium:**Â Selenium is a mineral has many functions in the body; like other minerals, it is needed for a healthy immune system. Selenium is available in many foods and is also available in supplement form. Most selenium studies to date have focused on thyroid disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Recently, there are scientific papers that have been published as âLetters to the Editorâ and similar that suggest that selenium may be beneficial, but these papers are largely observational, have many limitations, and have not gone through the rigorous peer-review process to validate the research methods and claims made. Without further validation, they should be interpreted very cautiously. At present, there is not enough scientific evidence to suggest that selenium supplementation will prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19.\n\n  [1]: https://www.who.int/campaigns/connecting-the-world-to-combat-coronavirus/healthyathome/healthyathome---healthy-diet\n  [2]: https://www.who.int/southeastasia/outbreaks-and-emergencies/novel-coronavirus-2019/fact-or-fiction\n  [3]: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters\n",
    "What our experts say": "While a varied and balanced diet including fruits and vegetables does help to support the immune system in general, there is no evidence to suggest that special diets, consumption of particular foods, or taking vitamin, mineral, or herbal supplements will prevent, treat or cure COVID-19. \n\nFor information about the attributed of specific foods or drinks, please see the '**Background & Context**' section for this question.\n",

    "Question": "Is a high dosage of paracetamol effective in treating or curing COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background & context": "Paracetamol is an analgesic (pain reliever) that can address minor to moderate cases of aches, pains, and fever. A common brand name of Acetaminophen is Tylenol. Acetaminophen is often confused with ibuprofen, another pain reliever that is commonly referred to as Advil, one of the commercial brands of ibuprofen. The main difference between the two is that ibuprofen has anti-inflammatory effects, making it a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) whereas acetaminophen does not, and therefore is not considered an NSAID.\n\nConfusion between the two was exacerbated in the context of COVID-19 following a tweet in mid-March by Franceâs Minister of Solidarity and Health, which claimed that taking anti-inflammatory drugs (such as Advil) could contribute to worsening a COVID-19 infection, and that acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) should be taken instead. The WHO initially took a similar position, recommending that ibuprofen be avoided for treating symptoms of COVID-19, but changed their stance on March 19 to say that they do not recommend avoiding ibuprofen to treat COVID-19 symptoms. Though there is no strong evidence that ibuprofen worsens COVID-19 symptoms, some public health bodies such as UK's National Health Service only recommend taking acetaminophen for COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nAccording to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the dailyÂ _maximum_Â oral dose for adults is 3 gramsÂ per dayÂ though other sources (including the Merck Manual) suggest that up to 4 gramsÂ per dayÂ is generally well tolerated in healthy adults. Paracetamol can be toxic to the liver in high doses or when used in combination with alcohol, some other medications, or for patients with existing liver or kidney problems, those who are malnourished or underweight, or those of advanced age. It is important to follow packaging instructions carefully when taking this or any over the counter medications, and a medical professional should be consulted for additional, personalized guidance.\n\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "Paracetamol can help relieve symptoms associated with COVID-19, but it cannot cure the viral infection.\n\nParacetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a medication commonly used for mild to moderate pain and aches relief, and fever reduction. Since some people infected with COVID-19 experience fever, body aches and headaches, this drug has been prescribed to relieve those symptoms. Paracetamol can provide some relief for patients with these symptoms, but it is not a cure against COVID-19.\n\nParacetamol made news headlines early in the pandemic because some governments, including the United Kingdom and France, and the World Health Organization encouraged people with COVID-19 to take paracetamol rather than ibuprofen â another drug used to help manage symptoms like fever, headache, or body aches. At the time, there were concerns about a link between ibuprofen and other drugs that could be prescribed to COVID-19 patients (such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs) that could lead to an increased risk for illness or for worsening of COVID-19 symptoms. As the pandemic evolved, the WHO changed their stance on March 19 2020 to say that they do not recommend avoiding ibuprofen to treat COVID-19 symptoms. \n\nWhile paracetamol is routinely used to relieve COVID-19 symptoms, it is important to strictly respect the dosage prescribed as stated on the medication bottle. The dosage of paracetamol for adults is 1-2 500 milligram tablets up to four times in 24 hours, with at least four hours in between doses. Any higher amount can be dangerous and is not advised.\n",

    "Question": "What do we know so far about the ability of asymptomatic people to transmit the virus?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "On: COVID-19 & asymptomatic carriers",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Newsroom"
    ],
    "Background & context": "There is concern about transmission by people without symptoms because this makes disease prevention more challenging. For example, while it is a helpful public health measure to recommend that people self-isolate when ill, it is insufficient to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus when someone who never develops symptoms or who has not yet developed symptoms can still infect others.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Asymptomatic people, which are defined as people who do not have symptoms but have been infected with COVID-19, have significant potential to spread the virus to hundreds people.Â We don't know exactly how many people are asymptomatic, but estimates range from a small percentage (4%) up to as many as 81% of cases in some settings. However, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's (U.S. CDC) director estimated that roughly 35% of people infected with COVID-19 may never have symptoms. Meanwhile, Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force and U.S. Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, estimated that 25% - 50% ofÂ cases were asymptomatic. Some studies have noted that asymptomatic carriers might be the biggest spreaders of COVID-19 in certain populations. There is also evidence to suggest that pre-symptomatic people infected with COVID-19  - people who eventually develop symptoms but haven't had any yet - spread the most amount of virus in the time before they have symptoms.\n\nIt is important to note that people without any symptoms are capable of transmitting the virus to others, and may be spreading it without ever knowing they are infected. This is why it is so important that everyone wear masks, wash their hands vigorously for 20 seconds, and maintain a distance of six feet between themselves and others. \n\nUPDATED July 11, 2020: The U.S. CDC has revised its \"current best estimate\" and now advises that it estimates 40% of people infected with COVID-19 are asymptomatic. The World Health Organization has yet to provide an official estimate and noted that it will vary across populations.\n",

    "Background & context": "Aerosol/airborne transmission is not considered the main route for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, but it can happen and certain environments often support super spread events, like an indoor environment with poor ventilation. Since most of COVID-19 testing is based on symptoms and/or exposure to a person infected with COVID-19, expanding beyond these criteria to include individuals who were in certain environments where aerosol transmission might happen (e.g. a choir practice or fitness class), might mean more people will get tested. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Though the potential for airborne transmission likely wouldn't change testing methods outside of a push for more extensive testing in general, it might influence policy regarding mandating mask wearing, air purification and ventilation systems, and other methods of prevention related to airborne viral spread.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is not airborne in the traditional sense.Â COVID-19 spreads primarily through relatively large respiratory droplets that fall to the ground and into faces and bodies of others. These larger droplets, 'respiratory droplets,â are wet from saliva and mucus and fall quickly to the ground. Scientists think this type of infectious droplet is how the majority of COVID-19 infections spread.Â \n\nOn the other hand, examples of airborne diseases are tuberculosis and measles, and the way these diseases spread is primarily through the air in smaller particles called 'microdroplets' or 'droplet nuclei.' Smaller droplets can stay in the air for longer periods of time because they are so small and light. Exhalation, talking, coughing, and singing can cause these small droplets to linger in the air for hours after a person leaves a room. SARS-CoV-2 viral particles may be part of these tiny droplets, and can travelÂ beyond 6 feet (2m) in certain situations, but the disease is still not understood to be transmitted primarily through lingering infectious particles in the air.Â \n\nThe aerosol or airborne transmission of COVID-19 occurs more indoors in close contact. This might mean that people who don't fall into the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-defined category of \"exposed\" to the virus (within 6 feet or 2m of an infected person for more than 15 minutes), but were in the same room as an infected person for an extended period of time, may now be considered âexposedâ and require testing.\n\nThere is currently some controversy around this topic, as 239 scientists recently sent a letter to the World Health Organization (WHO) urging them to recognize the potential of people catching the virus from droplet nuclei via airborne transmission. These scientists believe that the evidence supporting the concept of airborne transmission mean current procedures like social distancing and vigorous hand-washing do not provide enough protection from virus-carrying microdroplets that can stay suspended in the air for hours. Thus, the potential for people inhaling these droplet nuclei into their noses and mouths means additional prevention steps are needed. The WHO previously maintained that the novel coronavirus is mainly spread by respiratory droplet transmission, but has since acknowledged the emerging evidence for airborne transmission in \"crowded, closed, poorly ventilated settings,\" while cautioning that the evidence is preliminary and should be assessed further.\n",

    ],
    "Background & context": "The public health community is continually learning about how the novel coronavirus spreads, and what transmission routes are most likely to make it spread. Because of this continual learning in the public health community, there has been public confusion around how easily SARS-CoV-2 spreads, and through which routes. \n\nConfusion is particularly centered around the virus spreading from touching an infected surface and the virus spreading from airborne transmission. Person-to-person spread is the most well understood form of transmission as well as the main transmission route for COVID-19. \n\nSuch confusion has led to debate around the need to wipe down groceries, wear gloves, avoid petting neighborhood animals, and other steps to mitigate surface transmission. Though surface transmission is not thought to be the main way SARS-CoV-2 spreads, it is still a risk and should be responded to with precaution. One way to think about it is that virus spread from person-to-person is direct transmission, whereas virus stemming from a surface requires two intermediaries: 1) touching the virus on a surface, and then right after 2) touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. One is more direct and therefore more common, but both require caution.\n\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention, COVID-19 doesn't easily spread from contaminated surfaces to humans. While it is not likely, it is still possible for the virus to spread through contaminated surfaces. \n\nRecent studies suggest that the more humid a region may be, the longer the virus may survive on surfaces. Another study found that the virus can remain on surfaces like plastic and steel for 48-72 hours, and for up to 24 hours on cardboard. If a person touches a contaminated surface with traces of the virus and then proceeds to touch their eyes, nose, or mouth, they could still become infected if the surface contains large amounts of the virus. Washing your hands for 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, and cleaning surfaces often is an important step in stopping the potential spread of the virus. The virus that causes COVID-19 primarily spreads through close, person-to-person contact, not through surface contamination, so continuing to maintain six feet (two meters) of distance, wearing a mask, and staying home as much as possible are the key steps in combatting the virus.\n\nThe risk of contracting the virus from the surfaces of animals and pets is also considered to be low. The U.S. CDC noted in June 2020 that there is currently no evidence that animals have a significant role in spreading COVID-19 and the risk of animals spreading it to humans is low. However, more studies are needed to determine if and how a variety of animals might be impacted by the virus.\n\n",

    "Question": "Why are smell tests being proposed over temperature checks at workplaces?",

    "Source of the question": [

    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "There is growing interest in smell tests to supplement temperature testing during the current pandemic. Loss of smell, also called anosmia, is one of the possible symptoms of COVID-19. In some patients who have tested positive for COVID-19, loss of smell is the only reported symptom. The potential for a smell test serving as a better diagnostic for COVID-19 may lie in anosmia's unique link to COVID-19. Dr. Andrew Badley of the Mayo Clinic further explains this point as he stated âMy impression is that anosmia is an earlier symptom of Covid-19 relative to fever, and some infected people can have anosmia and nothing else. So itâs potentially a more sensitive screen for asymptomatic patients.â\n\nAdditionally, temperature checks can be insufficient for screening because patients with COVID-19 may not have a fever, and there are other health conditions that can cause a fever. Loss of smell is more unique to COVID-19. While smell tests can be helpful to add to temperature screenings at workplaces, schools, airports, restaurants and other locations, it is important to remember that infected people can still transmit COVID-19 without showing any symptoms like fever or loss of smell.\n\n",
    "What our experts say": "While many businesses and public spaces have begun using temperature checks as a way to try to identify people who might be infected with COVID-19, several studies have proposed that using a smell test in addition to a thermometer check may be a more accurate way of detecting potential cases. The reasons for this are numerous, and are mostly due to concerns about the effectiveness of temperature checks. Some of these issues include:\n- The fact that many people with COVID-19 never develop any symptoms such as fevers;\n- People with fevers might not have the virus at all and could have any number of other illnesses;\n- Infrared/non-contact thermometers are often inaccurate and operating errors may occur; and\n- People who take over-the-counter medication for fevers might be ill but will not present with a fever.\nUsing a temperature check alone is not an effective strategy to detect COVID-19 infections at public sites. On the other hand, the potential benefits of a smell test are numerous, as the loss of smellâ also called 'anosmia'âis relatively unique to COVID-19, whereas fevers are common symptoms in many illnesses. \n\nFor instance, a recent preprint study (awaiting peer-review) showed that COVID-19 patients were 27 times more likely to have lost their sense of smell than people without the virus, but only 2.6 times more likely to have fever or chills than those without the virus. Another study demonstrated that people with a loss of smell are \"more than 10 times more likely to have COVID-19 than other causes of infection,\" according to Dr. Carol Yan, making it a more accurate marker for COVID-19 than a fever would likely be, as they have many other causes and are associated with many other illnesses. Reasons like this are why many health experts believe that a combination of a smell test in addition to temperature checks could more accurately test and identify people for COVID-19.\n\n",

    "Question": "Is it true that India's Bharat Biotech is not too far away from finding a vaccine for COVID-19 as they have now been approved for human trials?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Partner Organization"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "India"
    ],
    "Background & context": "Bharat Biotech International Limited is a Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company that focuses primarily on manufacturing vaccines and bio-therapeutics. It has produced over 160 patents since starting operations in 1996. On June 29, 2020, Bharat Biotech announced that it received regulatory approval for Phase 1 and Phase 2 human clinical trials for COVAXIN, Indiaâs first homegrown vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) after submitting data from preclinical studies. The vaccine was developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology (NIV). ICMR has announced an ambitious deadline of August 15th 2020 to launch the vaccine, which has been criticized by doctors and researchers as a rushed and impractical timeline that carries substantial risks. ICMR has clarified that the intention is to complete the trials as fast as possible and speed up recruitment of participants, but everything will depend on the results of the clinical trials.\n",
    "What our experts say": "At this time it is unlikely that a vaccine for COVID-19 will be produced in the near future. The Indian Council of Medical Research, the primary body overseeing clinical research for COVID-19 in India, has pushed to fast-track clinical trials for the Bharat Biotech-developed drug COVAXIN. ICMR has announced an ambitious deadline of August 15th 2020 to launch the vaccine, which has been criticized by doctors and researchers as a rushed and impractical timeline that carries substantial risks. ICMR has clarified that the intention is to complete the trials as fast as possible and speed up recruitment of participants, but everything will depend on the results of the clinical trials. \n\nThe timeline to develop a safe and effective vaccine is lengthy and requires several stages of clinical trials, as well as plenty of regulatory oversight. This process usually takes several months and can continue for more than a year. Bharat Biotech, the pharmaceutical maker of COVAXIN, has obtained regulatory approval for Phase 1 and 2 human clinical trials for its vaccine. However, by August 15, 2020 it is not likely that the vaccine will pass the next round of human clinical trials and be ready for use,  as the ICMR has indicated. \n\nIn a directive to researchers at 12 healthcare institutions, Dr. Balram Bhargava, the Director-General of ICMR, claimed that the worldâs first COVID-19 vaccine should complete clinical trials soon in order to be ready for use by August 15th, Indiaâs Independence Day. However, the data from the pre-clinical studies on the vaccine has not yet been published. Even if pre-clinical data is promising, human clinical trials that are necessary to deploy a vaccine take place in stages that take a very long time, in order to assess efficacy and safety. The process typically takes well over 12 months to complete.\n\nLots of testing happens in animals before a vaccine begins phased testing in humans. During the first stage of vaccine testing on humans (Phase I), a new vaccine is provided to small groups of peopleâwhich is the first time the vaccine is tested in humans. The second stage (Phase II) involves testing the vaccine on people who have similar characteristics (such as age and physical health) to the target population, which means the group for which the vaccine is intended. The goal of this stage is to identify the most effective dosages and schedule for Phase III trials. The final stage (Phase III) provides the vaccine to hundreds of people across several different healthcare settings from the target population to see how safe and effective it is. Once the vaccine clears this last stage, the manufacturer can apply for a license from regulatory authorities to market for human use.\n",

    "Question": "What do we know so far about nebulizer-inhaled steroids as a treatment or cure for COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Subcategory": "Steroid",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Partner Organization"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "In the U.S., a Texas doctor has been recently promoting the use of inhaled steroids such as budesonide to treat COVID-19, which has gained attention on social media. However, there have been no studies to show that inhaled steroids are beneficial in treating COVID-19. \n\nRegarding steroids in general, recent studies have shown that the steroid dexamethasone may be effective in treating severe cases of COVID-19 when given orally or through an IV (intravenous). However, this same impact has not been demonstrated in patients with mild or moderate cases or when dexamethasone is administered through a nebulizer. It should be noted that giving steroids to patients who are not severely ill with COVID-19 might cause more harm than benefit as steroids are known to suppress the immune system rather than help it fight infections more strongly. \n\n",
    "What our experts say": "There are currently no clinical trials or observational studies on the use of inhaled steroids in COVID-19 patients. More research is needed before repurposing these drugs as a COVID-19 treatment. \n\nThere have been rumors circulating about using \"nebulizers\" to inhale steroids, such as the anti-inflammatory drug budesonide (brand name Pulmicort), to potentially treat COVID-19. \n\nInhaled steroids like budesonide can have side effects, and are also crucial for patients with health conditions who do not have COVID-19, so these should only be used when recommended by your doctor. Budesonide can be inhaled or taken orally, and when inhaled is part of a family of anti-inflammatory medications called inhaled steroids that are primarily used to help manage symptoms for conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Budesonide is a prescription-only drug that is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of COVID-19.\n\n\"Nebulizers\" are a type of inhaler that change liquid medications, like budesonide, into a mist that can be more easily inhaled into the lungs. Nebulizers can be more expensive than the most common type of inhaler used by people with asthma, and patients usually use nebulizers for specific reasons, such as if a child or someone with severe asthma is having difficulties inhaling medicine.\n",

    "Question": "What do we know so far about airborne transmission and how does it differ from respiratory droplet transmission? ",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Transmission",
    "Subcategory": "Differences between airborne transmission and respiratory droplets",
    "Background & context": "Respiratory droplet transmission happens when disease spreads through droplets expelled by an infected person, through coughing, sneezing, talking, or even just breathing; these droplets are larger than 5-10 micrometers. One micrometer is one millionth of a meter. Respiratory droplets are _relatively_ heavy, and fall to the ground quickly. In contrast, airborne transmission is when residue from droplets smaller than 5 micrometers, or dust particles carrying the virus, stay suspended in the air for longer and disperse farther by air currents. Scientists and the World Health Organization (WHO) have recognized that evidence is emerging on the possibility of airborne transmission, particularly in \"crowded, closed, poorly ventilated settings.\" If airborne transmission of COVID-19 is significant, this has major implications for containment efforts (ex. masks may be needed indoors and in socially-distant settings, ventilation systems may need to minimize recirculating air and find ways to filter or disinfect contaminated air, etc.). \n",
    "What our experts say": "There is mounting evidence that COVID-19 can spread through airborne transmission, which is when a person infected with COVID-19 releases tiny droplets of fluid into the air called 'droplet nuclei' by coughing, sneezing, talking, or during medical procedures involving the release of these types ofÂ fluids. Droplet nuclei are very light, relatively dry, and microscopic in size so they can remain suspended in the air like a mist, which is why airborne transmission is also called 'aerosol transmission, and pose a risk of infection to people in close proximity. This is different from the prevailing theory that the virus spreads through bigger respiratory droplets that are heavier, fall to the ground relatively quickly, and do not remain suspended in the air or spread through the air. \n\nThe risk of airborne transmission remains under research**, **but it is potentially thought to be higher risk in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. Retrospective analyses of \"super-spreader\" events, where a significant number of people have been infected at a single event, demonstrate that airborne transmission was likely responsible for infecting multiple people in the absence of direct, physical contact. One study analyzed an outbreak involving three separate families in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China and found that the spread pattern pointed to aerosol transmission due to poor ventilation in the restaurant. \n\nUntil July 7, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) continued to claim that evidence pointed to respiratory droplet transmission as the most plausible route of transmission for the virus, but 239 experts and public health professionals have cautioned against ruling out the possibility of airborne transmission and the WHO acknowledged emerging evidence regarding airborne transmission in poorly ventilated spaces on July 8, 2020. Public health experts have repeatedly warned that airborne transmission is most likely contributing to transmission, especially in indoor spaces, and recommendations should incorporate the need for sufficient ventilation, high efficiency filtration, and limiting crowded spaces, in addition to universal adoption of masks, social distancing, and frequent hand washing with soap and water.\n\nUPDATED: July 11, 2020: On July 9, 2020, the WHO has acknowledged that certain medical procedures can cause COVID-19 to be spread through airborne transmission. The group also noted that the potential for COVID-19 to spread through the air in crowded, indoor spaces that are inadequately ventilated \"cannot be ruled out.\" The WHO stated that more studies are urgently needed on this topic and reiterated their stance that the virus is primarily spread through contact and respiratory droplets.\n\n",

      "Philippines"
    ],
    "Background & context": "As we learn more about COVID-19 and the way it is spread to humans, we will learn more about why the virus seems to impact the lungs of many people. Unlike most viruses humans come into contact with, COVID-19 is new, so humans have not had the ability to gradually build up their immune systems to defend themselves from the virus over time. This may be part of the reason why the virus continues to spread rapidly around the world and can cause significant symptoms in 20% of cases.\n",
    "What our experts say": "COVID-19 enters the body through the nose, mouth, and eyes. This happens primarily when someone infected with the virus releases small droplets of liquid that contain part of the virus through actions like coughing, sneezing, speaking, or singing. These small bits of virus range in size, from the wet, teardrop-sized types of droplets you might see when you sneeze, to microscopic ones that are so light and dry, they might remain in the air for hours. When a person is in close contact with these droplets, the virus enters the body through these three areas. Then, the virus lands at the back of the throat, also called the top of the upper respiratory tract, in roughly 80% of people who have mild cases of infection. For other more severe cases, the virus can then move down to the lungs, potentially causing pneumonia, which happens in 15-20% of cases, although most recover. \n\nWhen COVID-19 spreads to the lungs, it does not mean that they will be \"destroyed.\" It means that there is an infection involving fluid within tiny branches of air tubes or sacs in the lungs called 'alveoli.' These air sacs may fill up with so much liquid or pus that they become swollen, and their walls can thicken, so it is hard for oxygen to be processed and delivered through the lungs, making it harder to breathe. \n\nEvery virus has a different way of infecting humans, though many viruses gain entry into the body through the nose, mouth, and eyes and often cause upper respiratory infections like COVID-19.\n\n\n \n\n",

    "Question": "What do we know about the inflammatory syndrome impacting children with COVID-19?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background & context": "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) warns that risks of severe COVID-19 illness tend to increase with age, with people over 85 being at highest risk for hospitalization, intensive care, ventilation, and potentially death. Tragically, the lives of young people, including children, have also been lost during the COVID-19 pandemic. More evidence is emerging on how some young patients develop severe symptoms and complications related to COVID-19. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a serious and potentially fatal condition in young people, which can appear similar to Kawasaki's disease. In mid-May 2020, the U.S. CDC asked doctors across the country to look out for MIS-C cases. In June 2020, another two studies found over 300 children with MIS-C in the United States, which was reported widely in the media. Researchers around the world continue to study why some children are seriously affected by COVID-19 when the majority of young people have had relatively mild cases.\n",
    "What our experts say": "The majority of young people infected have had relatively mild cases of COVID-19. However, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (U.S. CDC) recently identified the more severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) as a new syndrome associated with the virus that causes COVID-19. This inflammatory syndrome was first identified in April 2020 and is characterized by inflammation in different body parts, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. While MIS-C is rare, it can be deadly. Symptoms in children include fever, abdominal (gut) pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes, or fatigue. This is a newly identified condition that requires more research, but doctors have observed that symptoms can develop within four weeks of exposure to the novel coronavirus. The inflammation can be managed with medicines that can prevent damage to vital organs. MIS-C occurs in young people under 21, according to its case definition, although it is thought to mostly affect children between the ages of 2 to 15 and is not commonly reported in babies. The U.S. CDC recommends immediately contacting a doctor if your child exhibits any of the symptoms of the inflammatory syndrome. We still do not know why some children experience symptoms, while others do not, and it is unclear if children with particular health conditions are more likely to get MIS-C. At this point, the best prevention measures include taking all precautions to avoid contracting the novel coronavirus, including hand washing, social distancing, avoiding public gatherings, and wearing masks.\n",

    "Question": "What does it mean for COVID-19 to impact the brain?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Symptoms",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & the brain",
    "Background & context": "COVID-19 has been linked to a series of health complications beyond respiratory failure, including neurological complications that can potentially damage the brain. Recently, news has been circulating about how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been associated with many different neurological syndromes, including nerve damage, delirium, and stroke. While the condition is not very common, doctors are currently looking at data from individual patients from around the world to assess how it has impacted patients.\n\nThese neurological complications have also been reported during previous epidemics, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak more recently in 2012.\n",
    "What our experts say": "Physicians and scientists are learning more about how COVID-19 impacts organs outside of the respiratory system, such as the brain. The emerging evidence has revealed that some COVID-19 patients experience neurological symptoms, which impact the nervous system, composed principally of the brain, spinal cord, nerves, and ganglia (cell bodies that relay nerve signals). \n\nIn early March 2020, observational data from 58 patients in France indicated the presence of neurological symptoms such as agitation, confusion, disorientation, and encephalopathy (brain damage). In April 2020, a study was published on 214 COVID-19 patients in China with \"severe infection,\" where over a third were reported to experience neurological symptoms, including acute cerebrovascular diseases and impaired consciousness.\n\nIn July 2020, another study on over 40 British patients provided additional evidence about neurological symptoms, ranging from brain inflammation and delirium to nerve damage and stroke. Some of these patients reported severe symptoms, such as strokes and paralysis resulting from nerve damage, while others experienced more minor symptoms like breathlessness and fatigue. Most of the cases with brain inflammation were diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), which is a rare illness involving inflammation of the brain and spinal cord that results from viral infections. Data from London indicated an increase in ADEM cases for this study period during the pandemic, as the number of reported cases would typically have been expected over a 5-month period rather than a 5-week period in the city. \n\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was not detected in the cerebrospinal brain fluid of any of the British patients tested, which may suggest that the virus did not directly attack the brain and that the symptoms could have occurred post-infection.\n\nWith the increasing evidence of neurological symptoms, which have not been found to occur as commonly as respiratory symptoms, researchers and health care practitioners are continuing to observe patients around the world to learn more about how COVID-19 impacts on the brain. The long-term implications are still unclear, since COVID-19 is a new disease and there has not been enough time to observe the development of symptoms in patients over long periods of time.\n",

    "Background & context": "Vaccines are not medicines that can treat or cure diseases, as they are made for prevention. Vaccines contain a weakened, killed, or partial form of the same germs that cause the disease in order to stimulate the body's immune response to develop immunity without having to get sick. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that there are around 160 vaccines for COVID-19 in development as of July 6, 2020, with at least 21 vaccine candidates under clinical evaluation and 139 under pre-clinical evaluation. This includes U.K.'s Oxford University and AstraZeneca vaccine candidate that is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials with 5,000 people in Brazil and 4,000 people in the U.K., Australia's University of Queensland vaccine candidate that started phase one clinical trials with 120 people to be observed over 12 months (including a proportion of people assigned to receive a placebo for comparison), the U.S.'s Inovio Pharmaceuticals vaccine candidate that completed Phase 1 clinical trials with 40 people (reports suggest 94% had \"overall immune responses at week six after two doses\" and after eight weeks the vaccine candidate was considered \"safe and well-tolerated with no serious adverse events\"), and China's CanSino Biologics vaccine candidate that completed phase two clinical trials with 508 people and is planning to begin phase three clinical trials with 40,000 people from multiple countries.\n",
    "What our experts say": "COVID-19 vaccines are being developed to prevent people from getting the disease, not to treat or cure patients who already have the disease. Many experts continue to caution that a vaccine may not be widely available until the end of 2020 or beginning of 2021, which would already be record-breaking timing for vaccine development.\n\nRecently, Russia's Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University announced that they are completing human clinical trials of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 18 people vaccinated on June 18 (to be discharged on July 15) and 20 people vaccinated on June 23 (to be discharged on July 20). This is one of several human clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine candidates happening around the world, with some trials involving hundreds or thousands of people over observation periods of many months. Rigorous clinical trials are important to understand whether vaccine candidates are safe and without major negative side effects, as well as whether vaccine candidates are effective and can actually provide immunity for long periods of time.\n\nRussia's announcement of their human clinical trials has been accompanied by projections that the vaccine could be distributed in August and mass produced by private corporations in September. There are many challenges in scaling up from a vaccine candidate that has been tested on a few dozen people in one country to a commercially available vaccine that is available and suitable for millions of diverse people around the world. \n",

    "Question": "What are human challenge trials for vaccines?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Prevention",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & vaccines",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Social Media"
    ],
    "Country question was sourced from": [
      "USA"
    ],
    "Background & context": "In a human challenge trial, a volunteer receives a potential vaccine and then the volunteer is intentionally exposed to the virus to see if the vaccine works. Human challenge trials are sometimes used to test vaccines for illnesses that have a known cure (like malaria and cholera), but there are ethical problems in performing a human challenge trial for COVID-19. With COVID-19, there is a risk that someone could become seriously ill or even die from an infection since there is not a known cure.\nKnowing that human challenge trials may be needed, and as treatments and vaccines are developed for COVID-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued guidance to scientists, doctors, ethicists, and researchers in May 2020. The WHO document provides an overview of the ethics involved, reviews why the studies are being considered, and lists eight criteria for studies to meet for possible consideration. The criteria are designed to ensure that there is adequate scientific justification, that risks and benefits have been carefully considered, that studies are performed with consultation and coordination among members of the public as well as experts and policy-makers, and that study sites are equipped to conduct research to meet the highest clinical and ethical standards, and to ensure that participants are selected to minimize risk.\nHuman challenge trials take many months to plan and, in the setting of a global pandemic, many experts argue that there is no time to waste in planning for these trials to begin. In an open letter to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, 15 Nobel Laureates and over 100 top scientists and researchers encouraged preparation for human challenge trials for COVID-19 vaccines. The letter was organized by an advocacy group that has collected human challenge trial volunteer signatures from more than 30,000 people in over 140 countries.\n",
    "What our experts say": "A human challenge trial (HCT) is a study that deliberately infects volunteers with a virus after they've been given a vaccine, in order to see if the vaccine is effective. HCTs are designed to do this by taking a group of healthy volunteers in which researchers give half of the group a vaccine for a specific illness, and the other half a placebo (a fake drug they think is a real vaccine). Next, the researchers purposely expose the entire group to the real virus in a laboratory at a high enough dosage for them all to become infected. After being exposed to the virus, if the group that was given the vaccine does not become sick and the other group does fall ill, it means the vaccine is effective. The HCT process also allows researchers to see if any side effects might occur after volunteers are given the vaccine, which is an important part of studying vaccines.\n\nHCTs are different than more traditional vaccine trials, which give half of a group of healthy volunteers a vaccine for a specific illness and the other half of the group a placebo, in order to see how bodies respond when they are exposed to the virus in their day-to-day lives, outside of the laboratory. In comparison to these other types of vaccine trials, one potential benefit of HCTs is how quickly all the volunteers are exposed to the virus, so researchers might know more rapidly whether or not their vaccine is effective. Other benefits of HCTs include the fact that HCTs are done in settings where researchers can control the amount of time that passes, who gets to participate in the trial, and how volunteers are exposed to the virus, and they can also involve a smaller number of participants than other medication studies. Comparatively, the way HCTs are designed means they are not able to resemble how people get infected by viruses in the real world, outside of labs, and the amount of people involved in the trials might be much smaller than would participate in more traditional trials.\n\nHCTs are controversial and have caused debates about the ethics of infecting healthy volunteers with a virus that doesn't have a cure and can ultimately cause death. Though HCTs have studied medications for illnesses like typhoid, cholera, and malaria, those diseases all had proven medical treatments that could stop disease progression if the vaccine did not work. In the case of COVID-19, few treatment options exist so the amount of risk involved â even in healthy, young, willing volunteers â might be too great for researchers to take on.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Question": "If there is no cure for COVID-19, what are people getting treated for in hospitals?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Background & context": "People who are admitted to the hospital need care that cannot be provided at home or in a clinicâwhether or not there is a cure or specific treatment for their illness. While hospitalized patients may have had surgery to fix a broken bone, or may be given medicines to cure a bacterial infection or kill cancer cells, other therapies are given to patients to help them feel better even though they cannot cure the illness that actually causes their symptoms. For example, supportive care may include things like oxygen or special inhaled medications to help patients breathe better, fluids given intravenously to prevent or treat dehydration, or medications to decrease inflammation or fever. All of these therapies are commonly used in the hospital, but they are not designed to cure a patient of an infection, cancer, or other condition.\n",
    "What our experts say": "People with severe COVID-19 illness often require medical care due to the symptoms they experience, like trouble breathing, chest pressure, fatigue, etc. While there is no specific treatment or cure for COVID-19, as it is a new viral infection, people are receiving supportive treatment to help them recover, though some people eventually die as a result of the virus. Supportive treatment is treatment that helps to alleviate the symptoms caused by an illness but can't actually cure the illness itself. Supportive care gives symptoms relief while the infection naturally subsides over time, at which point the symptoms diminish greatly and patients can go back home. Examples of this include giving oxygen to a patient, injecting steroids to reduce inflammation, giving ventilation to help them breathe, and other necessary medical interventions that do not stop the virus but do treat the more severe symptoms.\n",

    "Question": "What is the best measure (cases, deaths or hospitalizations) for measuring the level of infection in a community?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Transmission",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & epidemiology",
    "Background & context": "There are many numbers and statistical values that are commonly in the news to show how well countries are doing at managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Some countries are reporting very high numbers of infected people (cases) and some are reporting very high numbers of deaths. \n\nIf we were to compare two groups (Group A and Group B) that each had 1,000 deaths, at a glance, the numbers may appear similar.Â Â If we were to find out, however, that Group A had 10,000 people with the virus and 1,000 died, that would mean that 10% of those infected in the population had died. If Group B had 100,000 people with the virus and 1,000 died, that would mean that 1% of those infected in the population had died.Â Â The difference between Group A and Group B is much more significant when viewed this way; the patients in Group A were far more likely to die than those in Group B.\n\nThough there is scientific evidence that suggests that older people or those with existing medical conditions like diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure are at higher risk of becoming infected and seriously ill from COVID-19, genetics, dietary habits, and other factors may play an important role. True susceptibility to the virus is challenging to measure. Not everyone who is exposed to the virus becomes infected, and not everyone who is infected develops symptoms. \n",
    "What our experts say": "Ultimately, no single statistic or measurement can accurately indicate the state of a disease within a population. To best understand the level of infection in a community, all these numbers need to be looked at together. Until there is more routine testing to identify all infected patients (with or without symptoms), the risk of infection is likely to remain unclear.\n\nIn order to attempt to measure the level of infection in a community, we can look at the number of hospitalizations, the proportion of the population who has the disease at any given moment (period prevalence), or the number of new cases of disease over a given time interval (incidence rate). The number of COVID-19 deaths during a given period can provide an important snapshot to understand the impact of the virus, but it is not a very good measure of a population's risk of contracting the virus. \n\nTracking incidence rate is a more useful measure, because it helps us understand what proportion of an initially disease-free population develops the disease over a specified time period. This is a far more accurate measure of how likely a person in a population is to get infected compared to the number of deaths within a population.\n\nAdditionally, in trying to understand how the number of deaths vary between populations, it's best to compare the mortality rate (number of deaths in relation to the overall population), because simply looking at the number of deaths does not account for differences in the size of populations.\n",

    "Question": "Are children less susceptible to contracting the novel coronavirus?",
    "Status": "Published",
    "Category": "Transmission",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & children",
    "Background & context": "As many countries struggle to determine if or when it may be safe to reopen schools, childcare centers, and playgrounds, researchers and scientists are still evaluating how likely children are to become ill from COVID-19 and how likely they are to spread the virus amongst one another, to other family members, or more broadly in the community. While current scientific evidence suggests that children are less likely to become as sick as adults, children are still able to become ill, may require hospitalization, and may die as a result of COVID-19. It is not clear why children are less likely than adults to become ill, but experts generally believe that differences are related to immunity - the body'sÂ natural defenseÂ mechanismÂ whose function is to help fight infections.\n\nIf children do become infected with COVID-19, they may still spread the virus to parents or other adults at home, teachers at school, or other adults that they come into contact with in the community (i.e. churches, stores, social events). Children infected with the virus tend to have mild, cold-like symptoms (if they have symptoms at all), which caregivers may not recognize as COVID-19. In addition, they may not wash their hands enough or correctly, may not practice social distancing, may touch their faces often, and may not wear masks correctly (if they are over two years old and are able to wear masks).Â \n\nWhile scientific evidence does suggest that children with COVID-19 are less likely to become seriously ill than adults, experts argue that children alone cannot be considered when determining if or when it may be safe to open schools, childcare centers, and playgrounds. Ensuring safety for children, families, caregivers, teachers, and the community is important as scientists, doctors, and policy-makers consider further plans to respond to and plan for the next phases of the pandemic.\n",
    "What our experts say": "According to the Mayo Clinic in the U.S., children of all ages can catch the virus that causes COVID-19, but they do not become physically sick as often as adults. They are also less susceptible to experiencing severe side effects from the virus in comparison to older adults. However, some children do develop complications from COVID-19, such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), which is characterized by inflammation in different body parts, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. While MIS-C is rare, it can be deadly and remains poorly understood based on current research. \n\nSome evidence suggests that children may be less likely to contract the novel coronavirus, but it is still unclear whether this effect is due to limited interactions between children and hence fewer opportunities for transmission, or whether they are truly less susceptible to contracting the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) does not see a clear trend in the data yet, but large scale serological studies (studies that look at antibody presence in the blood) are currently underway and are likely to provide more clarity. Previous studies from Wuhan, China indicated that the virus was milder in children and transmission was fairly limited: a study of more than 72,000 cases by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that children under the age of 10 represented less than 1% of all cases. However, studies are ongoing to assess the level of susceptibility among children, and the evidence is still evolving.\n",

    "Category": "Tranmission",
    "Subcategory": "On: COVID-19 & surfaces",
    "Source of the question": [
      "Partner Organization"
    ],
    "Background & context": "The current science suggests that people most commonly become infected with COVID-19 through close contact with another infected person, even if the infected person is not showing symptoms. Close contact is when people are within about 6 feet (2 meters), and the infected person spreads the virus by coughing, sneezing, talking, or breathing into the close space.\n\nEven though the current science suggests that COVID-19 spreads most often through close personal contact, the public health community is continually learning about other ways that COVID-19 spreads. A major idea put forward is that COVID-19 could be spread from one person to another if the virus remains alive on surfaces like packages, food, plastic, or metals for long amounts of time, and that people touch their faces after having touched these surfaces. Multiple studies have analyzed how long the virus survives on different surfaces, and this evidence will continue to add to the understanding of the virus and how it is spread. This new evidence allows scientists to better understand whether or not people are likely to become infected by touching items in a market, collecting their mail or packages, or by contact with other surfaces in shared spaces (i.e. a table at a restaurant, a chair in an office) and public places (i.e. a bench at the park).\n",
    "What our experts say": "The virus that causes COVID-19 primarily spreads through close, person-to-person contact, not through surface contamination. However, the virus can live on surfaces and the amount of time that COVID-19 can survive on a surface depends on the material of the surface. According to recent studies, COVID-19 can survive from 3 hours to 7 days on surfaces, though the virus' lifespan varies greatly on different areas.\n\nIt should be noted that the amount of living virus that is on a surface decreases over time. In practice, the amount of the virus on a surface usually drops dramatically in the first few hours. It is also important to note that even though some of the living virus might still be detected on a surface after several hours or days, it might not be present in a large enough quantity to make someone sick.  \n\nAccording to The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine, the living virus could be detected on different surfaces for varying periods of time:\n\nâ¢Â **Aluminum**: 2-8 hours\nâ¢Â **Stainless steel**: 2-7 days\nâ¢Â **Paper**: 3 hours\nâ¢Â **Copper**: 4 hours\nâ¢Â **Cardboard**: 24 hours\nâ¢Â **Cloth**: 2 days\nâ¢Â **Wood**: 4 days\nâ¢Â **Plastic**: 3-7 days\nâ¢Â **Metal:**Â 5 days\nâ¢Â **Glass**: 5 days\nâ¢Â **Paper money**: 4 days\nâ¢Â **Face masks**: 7 days (**_Note:_**_ A small amount of viable virus was still present on the outside of the mask after 7 days, but masks should be frequently washed, sanitized, or be used only once._)\n\nIf a person touches a contaminated surface with traces of the virus and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth, they could become infected if the surface contains large amounts of the virus. This is why it is important to clean and disinfect any surfaces that people might come into contact with, especially those like doorknobs, cell phones, light switches, handles, countertops, sinks, toilets, and more. If possible, people should try to avoid touching high-contact surfaces in public. Washing your hands for 20 seconds, avoiding touching your face, maintaining six feet (two meters) of distance and wearing a mask are key steps in combatting the spread of the virus.\n\n",
    "Variation of the answer depending on country of residence": "Yes; places with more humidity and higher temperatures may lead to the virus surviving a shorter amount of time\t\n",
    "Does this answer vary depending on your race, ethnicity, age, sex or other demographic factors?": "No\t\n",
