    "Definition": "Respiratory droplets are small drops of a liquid, usually water, that are produced from humans sneezing, coughing, talking, breathing, singing, yawning, or even just breathing, that fall to the ground and surfaces over several minutes and travel over a short range: up to 2 feet (60 cm). These droplets contain tiny parts of a virus (particles), so they can spread illnesses between people when someone touches a surface that a respiratory droplet has landed on and then touches their eyes, mouth, or nose or other body part. Unlike aerosolized pathogens, respiratory droplets are larger in size at over 5-10μm (hence being referred to also as 'large droplets'), don't travel as far, and don't remain in the air for long periods of time. Most respiratory illnesses are spread by respiratory droplets. \n\n",

    "Term": "aerosol/airborne transmission",
    "Definition": "Aerosol transmission or airborne transmission occurs when tiny drops of a germ or infectious agent (droplet nuclei, or evaporated residues from droplets expelled by an infected person) that can cause a disease (pathogen) stay in the air for some time after someone coughs, sneezes, talks, vomits, sings, laughs, or exhales and these drops become a fine mist (aerosolized). Droplet nuclei can also be considered evaporated residues from droplets. These small particles, known as aerosols, can travel sizable distances even though they may not be visible to the human eye. Airborne transmission can also sometimes occur from dust particles carrying the virus.\n\n\nWhen another person comes into contact with contamhinateds aerosolized mist, they become exposed to the pathogen hanging in the air as well. Unlike respiratory droplets, aerosolized pathogens are mostly dry, light, very small (under 5μm); these smaller particles can stay suspended in the air for longer and be dispersed farther by air currents, traveling short and long distances as they remain in the air. Some medical and cleaning procedures can also cause aerosol transmission of a pathogen like flushing toilets or putting a tube into a patient's throat to help them breathe.\n",

The term \"viable virus\" is commonly used to describe a virus that could infect someone if they were to come into contact with the virus on a surface or in the air. \n\nViruses die when they are not able to multiply inside cells, but how long it takes for them to die under those conditions varies, based on the virus, where it may be found, and how it may be spread. Viruses that are not inside of host cells can make people sick when they are spread in the air, on surfaces, in body fluids, in water, and via other methods. \n",

Air may be exchanged from the outside to the inside of buildings (as well as from the indie to the outside) via open doors and windows or through heating and air conditioning systems (often called heating ventilation and air conditioning systems- HVAC systems). In some cases, however, ventilation systems recirculate indoor air without exchanging air from outside. To control air flow, humidity, temperature, and other factors, fans, pumps, grates, ducts, and filters are common parts of ventilation systems.\n",

    "Definition": "There are many different kinds of bacteria that naturally live on the skin, as well as in the nose, mouth, and digestive tract. Most of the time these bacteria are not harmful and, in some cases, they have been shown to help with digestion and prevention of some illnesses.\n\nA bacterial infection occurs when harmful bacteria enter the body and begin to multiply. Bacterial infections can occur anywhere in the body including the lungs, throat, intestines, or on the skin. Symptoms of bacterial infection are different depending upon where the infection is located (i.e. a sore throat is a common symptom of _Streptococcus_ infection of the throat, food poisoning caused by bacteria may cause vomiting or diarrhea). Antibiotics may be used to treat bacterial infections and, if bacterial infections are left untreated, they can become severe. \n",

Tuberculosis is curable and preventable. TB is spread from person to person through the air. When people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into the air. A person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become infected.\nAbout one-quarter of the world's population has latent TB, which means people have been infected by TB bacteria but are not (yet) ill with the disease and cannot transmit the disease.\nPeople infected with TB bacteria have a 5–15% lifetime risk of falling ill with TB. Persons with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a higher risk of falling ill.\nWhen a person develops active TB disease, the symptoms (such as cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss) may be mild for many months. This can lead to delays in seeking care, and results in transmission of the bacteria to others. People with active TB can infect 5–15 other people through close contact over the course of a year.\n",

    "Definition": "According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, clinical trials are research studies performed on people, that are aimed at evaluating a medical, surgical, or behavioral intervention. They are the primary way that researchers find out if a new treatment, like a new drug or diet or medical device (for example, a pacemaker) is safe and effective in people. Often, a clinical trial is used to learn if a new treatment is more effective and/or has less harmful [side effects](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/safe-use-medicines-older-adults) than the standard treatment. Clinical trials require testing the health intervention in groups of volunteers which include, depending on the trials, healthy individuals and/or patients with a known health issue.\nOther clinical trials test ways to find a disease early, sometimes before there are symptoms. Still, others test ways to prevent a health problem. A clinical trial may also look at how to make life better for people living with a life-threatening disease or a chronic health problem. \nBefore the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/) (FDA) approves a clinical trial to begin, scientists perform laboratory tests and studies in animals to test a potential therapy’s safety and efficacy. If these studies show favorable results, the FDA gives approval for the intervention to be tested in humans.\n",

    "Definition": "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, ultraviolet (UV) rays are a part of sunlight that is an invisible form of radiation. UV rays can penetrate and change the structure of skin cells. There are three types of UV rays: ultraviolet A (UVA), ultraviolet B (UVB), and ultraviolet C (UVC). UVA is the most abundant source of solar radiation at the earth’s surface and penetrates beyond the top layer of human skin. Scientists believe that UVA radiation can cause damage to connective tissue and increase a person’s risk for developing skin cancer. UVB rays penetrate less deeply into skin, but can still cause some forms of skin cancer. Natural UVC rays do not pose a risk to workers because they are absorbed by the Earth’s atmosphere.\n",

    "Term": "placebo",
    "Definition": "Placebos are commonly used in clinical trials. They look like a medicine or vaccine, but placebos are not part of an actual treatment or vaccine being tested. \n\nOften placebos are used in clinical trials where volunteers are randomly assigned (by chance) to either a test group receiving the experimental intervention (e.g. medicine or vaccine), or to a control group receiving a placebo (like a \"sugar pill,\" salt water injection, or another item that looks like the test treatment). In many trials, no one—not even the research team—knows who gets the treatment or the placebo. When participants, family members, and staff all are “blind” to the treatment while the study is underway, the study is called a “double-blind, placebo-controlled” clinical trial.\n\nAt the end of the study, the researchers use statistical analysis to compare the results from the experimental group and the placebo group to evaluate if the results are different between the two. The researchers then determine whether the findings are different because of the experimental treatment. \n",

Blinding is commonly used in randomized controlled trials so that participants and researchers are unaware if patients are receiving the test treatment, placebo, or standard treatment. \n\nBlinding aims to reduce or eliminate biases that may impact how people behave, feel, or observe what happens during a study. When the study is finished, all people participating in the study (as participants or researchers) are unblinded and the study details are available.\n\nOther terms used for blinding include blind, blinded, or masked. A clinical research trial that is not blinded is called an \"open trial.\"\n",

    "Definition": "Randomization is a technique used in scientific research to divide participants into groups by chance, rather than assigning them by choice. Once patients meet the general criteria to be included in a study, randomization is done to reduce bias so that everyone who participates in the study has an equal chance of being in a treatment (or test) group or a control group. It prevents researchers from purposely selecting certain patients who are more likely to perform better in the study (e.g. patients who are younger or those who seem generally healthier). \n",

Using the same group, a test with lower sensitivity could have 80 positive test results and 20 people would receive false negative results even though they do indeed have the illness.\n\nSensitivity is also commonly called the \"true positive rate,\" \"recall,\" \"epidemiological sensitivity,\" \"clinical sensitivity,\" or \"probability of detection.\"\n",

Homeopathic medicines are not recommended in place of care provided by a healthcare provider.\n\nHomeopathic products are not regulated for content in many countries, so active and inactive ingredients may not reflect what is on the product package, and some ingredients may be toxic. There are many possible dangerous interactions that may occur between homeopathic products and other medications.

According to the American Red Cross Blood Services Division, blood types are determined based on whether or not they have one of two special molecules (called antigens) on the surface of red blood cells (A and/or B).  If the red blood cells do not contain either antigen, the blood type is O. In addition to the antigens, the + or - is determined by the presence (+) or absence (-) of a protein called the Rh factor.  Blood type is determined before birth and is genetically passed on from parents to their children.\n",

    "Term": "phased testing",
    "Definition": "A phased testing approach involves a series of steps, where each step involves careful study and evaluation with a series of checkpoints to decide whether to proceed to the next phase. For medicines and vaccines, the process is overseen by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US.\n\nSubstantial (preclinical) research needs to be completed by scientists before phased testing. Once the preclinical or \"pre-human\" research has been completed, there are three research phases of trials that take place. \n\nDuring the first stage (Phase 1), the new vaccine is provided to small groups of people—the first time the vaccine is tested in humans. This phase is used to learn if the vaccine or medication is safe, if it works, it there any serious side effects, and if the size of the dose is related to the side effects.\n\nThe second stage (Phase 2) involves testing the vaccine on people who have similar characteristics (such as age and physical health) to the target population, or the group for which the medicine or vaccine is intended. The goal of this stage is to learn what the most common short-term side effects are and understand how the volunteers respond to the medicine or vaccine.  In the case of a vaccine, in a Phase 2 Trial, researchers are specifically looking at how the immune system responds to the trial vaccine.\n\nThe final stage (Phase 3) provides the medicine or vaccine to hundreds or thousands of people to see how safe and effective it is and to identify the most common side effects. Once the medicine or vaccine clears this last stage, the manufacturer can apply for a license from regulatory authorities (like the FDA) to market for human use.\n\nSometimes medications or vaccines that have already been approved by the U.S. FDA in clinical trials will enter into a Phase 4 trial. This phase focuses on potential side effects from the vaccine or medication that were not seen in the first three phases. This phase also helps researchers understand how well a vaccine works over a longer time frame and how safe it is, often with thousands of people over several years. Phase 4 is also called a 'post-marketing surveillance' trial.\n",

Short for ribonucleic acid, it carries genetic information, carries out biochemical reactions, and is used to make some proteins in cells. There are many types of RNA though the most commonly studies are messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). \n\nSome viruses are called RNA viruses, and these viruses have RNA as their genetic material. RNA viruses enter the host cells (cells from another living organism like a human or animal) and use the host's genetic material to multiply and spread. COVID-19 is an RNA virus (as are the common cold, influenza, HIV, SARS, MERS, Dengue Virus and many more).\n",

Monoclonal antibodies (the prefix \"mono-\" means one) are different from polyclonal antibodies (the prefix \"poly-\" means many):\n\n1) Monoclonal antibodies are made by identical immune cells cloned from a single parent cell; and\n2) Monoclonal antibodies work by binding to a part of the COVID-19 virus and signaling the body's immune system to attack \n\nDue to these properties, monoclonal antibodies have the potential to be produced with consistent quality and purity at a large scale. Additionally, monoclonal antibodies have the potential to provide therapeutic benefits to the immune system because they are highly selective in how they bond to specific antigens that cause disease. Medical applications of monoclonal antibodies have included drugs for cancer.\n",

    "Definition": "In general, surveillance is another way to say monitoring or watching and is thought of as an ongoing process for learning and understanding in public health. Public health surveillance systems are used to monitor health-related data at a population level (like in a neighborhood, city, state, country, or around the world). These systems help researchers and public health professionals understand patterns in how diseases spread, risk factors for diseases, how well vaccines work, how health is influenced by the environment, and many other things. \n\nPublic health surveillance is defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as “the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data essential to planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice.” \n",
