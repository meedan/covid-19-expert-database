These droplets contain tiny parts of a virus (particles), so they can spread illnesses between people when someone touches a surface that a respiratory droplet has landed on and then touches their eyes, mouth, or nose or other body part. Unlike aerosolized pathogens, respiratory droplets are larger in size at over 5-10μm (hence being referred to also as 'large droplets'), don't travel as far, and don't remain in the air for long periods of time. Most respiratory illnesses are spread by respiratory droplets. \n\n",

Tuberculosis is curable and preventable. TB is spread from person to person through the air. When people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into the air. A person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become infected.\nAbout one-quarter of the world's population has latent TB, which means people have been infected by TB bacteria but are not (yet) ill with the disease and cannot transmit the disease.\nPeople infected with TB bacteria have a 5–15% lifetime risk of falling ill with TB. Persons with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a higher risk of falling ill.\nWhen a person develops active TB disease, the symptoms (such as cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss) may be mild for many months. This can lead to delays in seeking care, and results in transmission of the bacteria to others. People with active TB can infect 5–15 other people through close contact over the course of a year.\n",

They are the primary way that researchers find out if a new treatment, like a new drug or diet or medical device (for example, a pacemaker) is safe and effective in people. Often, a clinical trial is used to learn if a new treatment is more effective and/or has less harmful [side effects][1] than the standard treatment. Clinical trials require testing the health intervention in groups of volunteers which include, depending on the trials, healthy individuals and/or patients with a known health issue.\nOther clinical trials test ways to find a disease early, sometimes before there are symptoms. Still, others test ways to prevent a health problem. A clinical trial may also look at how to make life better for people living with a life-threatening disease or a chronic health problem. \nBefore the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration][2] (FDA) approves a clinical trial to begin, scientists perform laboratory tests and studies in animals to test a potential therapy’s safety and efficacy. If these studies show favorable results, the FDA gives approval for the intervention to be tested in humans.\n\n  [1]: https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/safe-use-medicines-older-adults\n  [2]: https://www.fda.gov/\n",

UV rays can penetrate and change the structure of skin cells. There are three types of UV rays: ultraviolet A (UVA), ultraviolet B (UVB), and ultraviolet C (UVC). UVA is the most abundant source of solar radiation at the earth’s surface and penetrates beyond the top layer of human skin. Scientists believe that UVA radiation can cause damage to connective tissue and increase a person’s risk for developing skin cancer. UVB rays penetrate less deeply into skin, but can still cause some forms of skin cancer. Natural UVC rays do not pose a risk to workers because they are absorbed by the Earth’s atmosphere.\n",
