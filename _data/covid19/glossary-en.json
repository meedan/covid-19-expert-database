    "Definition": "Respiratory droplets are small drops of a liquid, usually water, that are produced from humans sneezing, coughing, talking, breathing, singing, yawning, or even just breathing, that fall to the ground and surfaces over several minutes and travel over a short range: up to 2 feet (60 cm). These droplets contain tiny parts of a virus (particles), so they can spread illnesses between people when someone touches a surface that a respiratory droplet has landed on and then touches their eyes, mouth, or nose or other body part. Unlike aerosolized pathogens, respiratory droplets are larger in size at over 5-10μm (hence being referred to also as 'large droplets'), don't travel as far, and don't remain in the air for long periods of time. Most respiratory illnesses are spread by respiratory droplets. \n\n",

    "Term": "aerosol/airborne transmission",
    "Definition": "Aerosol transmission or airborne transmission occurs when tiny drops of a germ or infectious agent (droplet nuclei, or evaporated residues from droplets expelled by an infected person) that can cause a disease (pathogen) stay in the air for some time after someone coughs, sneezes, talks, vomits, sings, laughs, or exhales and these drops become a fine mist (aerosolized). Droplet nuclei can also be considered evaporated residues from droplets. These small particles, known as aerosols, can travel sizable distances even though they may not be visible to the human eye. Airborne transmission can also sometimes occur from dust particles carrying the virus.\n\n\nWhen another person comes into contact with contamhinateds aerosolized mist, they become exposed to the pathogen hanging in the air as well. Unlike respiratory droplets, aerosolized pathogens are mostly dry, light, very small (under 5μm); these smaller particles can stay suspended in the air for longer and be dispersed farther by air currents, traveling short and long distances as they remain in the air. Some medical and cleaning procedures can also cause aerosol transmission of a pathogen like flushing toilets or putting a tube into a patient's throat to help them breathe.\n",

    "Term": "medicine",
    "Definition": "A medicine is a substance or therapy used to treat an illness, injury, or medical condition. Medicines are often thought of as liquids or pills that are prescribed as treatment, though medicines may also be prescribed in other forms (i.e. inhaled, intravenous, topical creams). The words medication, pharmaceutical, remedy, and drug are commonly used in the same way as the word medicine.\n\nThe_ practice_ of medicine is broadly defined as the art and science of maintaining and promoting health, and preventing and curing disease.\n",

Tuberculosis is curable and preventable. TB is spread from person to person through the air. When people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into the air. A person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become infected.\nAbout one-quarter of the world's population has latent TB, which means people have been infected by TB bacteria but are not (yet) ill with the disease and cannot transmit the disease.\nPeople infected with TB bacteria have a 5–15% lifetime risk of falling ill with TB. Persons with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a higher risk of falling ill.\nWhen a person develops active TB disease, the symptoms (such as cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss) may be mild for many months. This can lead to delays in seeking care, and results in transmission of the bacteria to others. People with active TB can infect 5–15 other people through close contact over the course of a year.\n",

    "Term": "clinical trial",
    "Definition": "According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, clinical trials are research studies performed on people, that are aimed at evaluating a medical, surgical, or behavioral intervention. They are the primary way that researchers find out if a new treatment, like a new drug or diet or medical device (for example, a pacemaker) is safe and effective in people. Often, a clinical trial is used to learn if a new treatment is more effective and/or has less harmful [side effects][1] than the standard treatment. Clinical trials require testing the health intervention in groups of volunteers which include, depending on the trials, healthy individuals and/or patients with a known health issue.\nOther clinical trials test ways to find a disease early, sometimes before there are symptoms. Still, others test ways to prevent a health problem. A clinical trial may also look at how to make life better for people living with a life-threatening disease or a chronic health problem. \nBefore the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration][2] (FDA) approves a clinical trial to begin, scientists perform laboratory tests and studies in animals to test a potential therapy’s safety and efficacy. If these studies show favorable results, the FDA gives approval for the intervention to be tested in humans.\n\n  [1]: https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/safe-use-medicines-older-adults\n  [2]: https://www.fda.gov/\n",

UV rays can penetrate and change the structure of skin cells. There are three types of UV rays: ultraviolet A (UVA), ultraviolet B (UVB), and ultraviolet C (UVC). UVA is the most abundant source of solar radiation at the earth’s surface and penetrates beyond the top layer of human skin. Scientists believe that UVA radiation can cause damage to connective tissue and increase a person’s risk for developing skin cancer. UVB rays penetrate less deeply into skin, but can still cause some forms of skin cancer. Natural UVC rays do not pose a risk to workers because they are absorbed by the Earth’s atmosphere.\n",

Once patients meet the general criteria to be included in a study, randomization is done to reduce bias so that everyone who participates in the study has an equal chance of being in a treatment (or test) group or a control group. It prevents researchers from purposely selecting certain patients who are more likely to perform better in the study (i.e. patients who are younger or those who seem generally healthier). \n",

    "Term": "arsenic album 30",
    "Definition": "Arsenic album (also called arsenious oxide, arsenic trioxide) is commonly used in homeopathic medicine as a powder, liquid, or tablet to treat digestive disorders, cough, and cold. There are no scientific guidelines that direct how, if, or when arsenic album should be used.\n\nWhile homeopathic references state that arsenic album contains minimal amounts of arsenic, some other references use arsenic and arsenic album interchangeably. Arsenic is a naturally occurring mineral and can be present in food products in small amounts. It is important to note that arsenic is known to be toxic when taken orally or inhaled (by dust or fumes). Long-term or high dose exposure can cause irritation of mucous membranes (i.e. tissues of the nose, throat, lungs), increased incidence of some types of cancer, and may cause brain, nervous system, kidney, and liver problems.\n",

    "Internal notes": "[@Emily LaRose][1] I’m not sure what we are trying to convey with “While homeopathic references state that arsenic album contains minimal amounts of arsenic, some other references use arsenic and arsenic album interchangeably.” The first part of the sentence talks about arsenic quantity and the second about names, but links the two.\n\n[@Christin Gilmer][2] I don't have an answer to this since I looked at a bunch of references and there was a lot of conflicting information (and my \"go to\" sources had nothing...).  I was highlighting that there is conflicting information available, and I am not comfortable taking a specific position (certainly not to say that it definitively doesn't contain arsenic when the products aren't regulated).  Thoughts? EL\n\n[@Emily LaRose][3] [@Christin Gilmer][4] Would it make sense to separate quantity (minimal amounts) and naming (use arsenic and arsenic album interchangeably) and maybe write two separate sentences, maybe: “Homeopathic references state that arsenic album contains minimal amounts of arsenic. Some other references use arsenic and arsenic album interchangeably.”\n[@Emily LaRose][5] [@Christin Gilmer][6] I think \"arsenic album\" should be \"arsenicum album\". arsenic is mineral, while \"arsenicum album\" is homeopathic medicine.

    "Definition": "Homeopathy (also called homeopathic medicine) is a medical system developed more than 200 years ago. It focuses on using products from plants, minerals, and animals to treat or prevent medical problems. According to the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, a 2015 comprehensive assessment of evidence by the Australian government's National Health and Medical Research Council that concluded that there is no reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective for any health condition. Homeopathic medicines are not recommended in place of care provided by a healthcare provider.\n\nHomeopathic products are not regulated for content in many countries, so active and inactive ingredients may not reflect what is on the product package, and some ingredients may be toxic. There are many possible dangerous interactions that may occur between homeopathic products and other medications. In addition, homeopathic products that contain heavy metals or alcohol may also be harmful.\n",
