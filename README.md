# This is a build system for Covid-19 Expert Database

This environment uses Jekyll with Contentful. It uses Contentful's [Jekyll-Contentful-Data-Import](https://github.com/contentful/jekyll-contentful-data-import) plugin. See the readme on the repository page to learn how to configure data import.

## Quick start
1. Install Ruby 2.x (eg with [rvm](https://rvm.io))
2. `bundle install` or `bundle install --path vendor/bundle` to install all the packages
3. Add Contentful Space and Access Token variables to your shell's configuration file (.bashrc or .bash_profile):

```
export CONTENTFUL_EDB_SPACE_ID=abc123
export CONTENTFUL_EDB_ACCESS_TOKEN=abc123
export CONTENTFUL_API_URL="cdn.contentful.com"
```

Variables are set in the contentful section of `_config.yml`. Get your Contentful space id and access token using the [Contentful web app](https://app.contentful.com/). Open the space that you want to access (the top left corner lists all spaces), and navigate to the *Settings > API keys*. Select the *API keys* option and there should be an existing API key under *Jekyll* for Digital Health Lab.

And run `source ~/.bashrc` or open new terminal to enable changes.

4. `jekyll contentful --rebuild` to build the site by fetching content from Contentful
5. `jekyll serve` to serve the site at [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000)
6. Edit .scss, .html and .js files. The browser should live-reload.

## Page Generation from Contentful Data

To generate pages in Jekyll based on Contentful data we are using the [jekyll-datapage_gen](https://github.com/avillafiorita/jekyll-datapage_gen) plugin. Specify in `_config.yml` the data files for which you want individual page to be generated. See plugin's documentation and our `config.yml` for the settings.

All pages are generated using the `page.html` layout template based on the entries in `pages.yaml` that were imported from Contentful.

## Deploy settings on Netlify

health.meedan.com is deployed on Netlify. Adding a website on Netlify is super easy. All these settings are under [Build & Deploy](https://app.netlify.com/sites/covid-19-expert-database/settings/deploys) section of [Netlify's web app](https://app.netlify.com). Here are the main steps:

1. Select which Github repository and branch to deploy.
2. Specify this build command: `jekyll contentful --rebuild`
3. Add build environment variables `CONTENTFUL_EDB_SPACE_ID`, `CONTENTFUL_EDB_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `CONTENTFUL_API_URL`.
4. Add build hook for Contentful's master and develop environment. Get the webhook urls using the [Contentful web app](https://app.contentful.com). Open the space and navigate to the *Settings > Webhooks*. You will see two webhooks already setup. See their details to copy the url or adjust what triggers it. See Contentful's [Intro to webhooks](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/webhooks/) to learn more.
